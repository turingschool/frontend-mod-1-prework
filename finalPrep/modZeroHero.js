// Create a function called assessSituation that takes three arguments - dangerLevel, saveTheDay, badExcuse

//   - badExcuse should be a string a hero would say if they are too afraid of the dangerLevel

// Your function should include an if/else statement that meets the following criteria
//   - Danger levels that are above 50 are too scary for your hero. Any danger level that is above 50 should result in printing the badExcuse to the console
//   - Anything dangerLevel that is between 10 and 50 should result in printing the saveTheDay string to the console
//   - If the dangerLevel is below 10, it means it is not worth your time and should result in printing the string "Meh. Hard pass." to the console.

// Reflection
// What parts were most difficult about this exerise?
// Executing the newest concepts - class and class methods. I had to reference
// older study material while I was completing the assignment


// What parts felt most comfortable to you?
// The tasks that we have had most repetition with - variable assignments,
// logs, if statements.

// What skills do you need to continue to practice before starting Mod 1?
// Definitely review and revisit object and class exercises
