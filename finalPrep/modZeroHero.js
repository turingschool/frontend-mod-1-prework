// Declare two variables - heroName AND specialAbility - set to strings

//   - badExcuse should be a string a hero would say if they are too afraid of the dangerLevel
// Your function should include an if/else statement that meets the following criteria
//   - Danger levels that are above 50 are too scary for your hero. Any danger level that is above 50 should result in printing the badExcuse to the console
//   - Anything dangerLevel that is between 10 and 50 should result in printing the saveTheDay string to the console
//   - If the dangerLevel is below 10, it means it is not worth your time and should result in printing the string "Meh. Hard pass." to the console.

// Reflection
// What parts were most difficult about this exerise?

// I had difficulty with the class methods. That concept has been difficult to fully understand for me, so it took the most tweaking.
// I also struggled with some syntax - capitalizing incorrectly or forgetting a ";" put me behind a few times.

// What parts felt most comfortable to you?

// I was able to complete the variables and variables functions piece easily. I was also more comfortable with creating an object and class,
// since I have done that work most recently.

// What skills do you need to continue to practice before starting Mod 1?

// Before Mod 1 I would like to work more on speed and syntax accuracy. I did not finish this assignment in 30 minutes, but I think that is a great goal.
// I need to review and solidify a lot of the information within the prework so that I can hit the ground running on the first day of Mod 1.
// Improving my note taking for concepts in Mod 1 prework could help with this, as well as finding more exercises similar to this one.
// Even with a couple of weeks between starting and finishing the prework, I have forgotten some concepts.
// Making sure those stick in my memory is what I would like to practice.
