## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

I do both, but I'm trying to improve. The parts about not wanting to be judged and trying to prove that I can do this rang loud. I need to reach out more in our Slack group. I'm often a lurker there and find solutions to something that more than a few of us are struggling with, but I tend to ask my questions to the people I personally (or at least tangentially) know because I am anxious to (I'm being honest here) look like I am competent, or at least not the last in the pack. This is BS, and I know it, but there are some lurking mental health issues that I have been trying to suss out.

I LOVED the rubber ducky idea to hone your questions and better understand how to ask them. I am now doing that with a framed picture I took of a groundhog (don't judge...) above my workstation.

Asking one question at a time via narrowing down what answer you need was helpful as well.

1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

Honestly, it felt normal for what I have experienced so far with Turing, and I appreciate the push to make me either figure it out or sink. I like that push, and I am used to it from my previous career, where I had to do that every day.

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

My take on a conditional statement is that it judges if code, or parts of code can run.
Daily life conditional: If i look out the window and see rain, I know to wear a waterproof outer layer. If i see sunshine and the air through an open window is warm, I will wear shorts & a t-shirt.
Web application example: I open a github tab in my browser, the code looks at whether or not I am logged in, if I am, then I may access my gits, otherwise it will not let me do so.

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

Syntax-wise, you add them using "else if (condition) {var outcome = "condition matches";}", and end multiple conditions using "else" or just the "if" part.
The program is evaluating if the first condition is met, and what code to execute if it is or is not met. If it is not, then the second conditional evaluates a second test, and decides what code to execute. this can repeat indefinitely.

1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

Debugging tools in your editor, browser, 

1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
