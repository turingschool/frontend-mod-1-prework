## Section 2 Reflection

**1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?**  

I feel that I wait too long to ask a question. I am usually shy and like to keep to myself. I usually feel scared to speak up and ask questions. After reading the blog posts, I think I will have to overcome this fear, especially with continuing at Turing. I am currently working towards it and hope to ask tons of questions in the future.

**2. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?**  
I feel that in Section 1 and Mod 0 it was so repetitive that I almost remembered everything like muscle memory. I felt comfortable and didnt think much about it. I had a couple 'duh' moments where I Googled something but clearly knew the answer in my head. I think that being 'uncomfortable' or having to find a solution myself helps me learn. This way I try to remember it my hardest so I dont have to look it up again.

**3. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.**  
A conditional statment is the if/else statements we used. It is a control statement that allows JavaScript to execute the statements we make in a more controlled way. An example of a conditional statement in my daily life is if weather is cold I wear warm clothing/ layers. I think an app that uses conditional statements is Snapchat. You will get certain photo filters depending on the time of day. Also, the snap map is usually dark at night and regular white during the daytimne.   
**4. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.**  
You can use && or || the computer then reads it as those two conditions need to be met.   

**5. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?**  
repl.it and &&, ||

**6. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?**  
Can we use if statements in loops?
