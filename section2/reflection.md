## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?
**I think at the moment I wait too long because of the reasons described in the article, like fear of being judged.**

1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?
**I experienced moments of both confidence and confusion. Some parts of the section I felt confident in doing, like I've built the muscle memory. Others required some head-scratching and Googling/digesting before I really felt like I got it.**

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.
**A conditional statement is essentially an "If, then" statement (or in the case of JavaScript, "if, else" and its other forms). I imagine most websites utilize conditionals when the user is currently logged in to an account or not. If a certain task requires being logged in, the website will then prompt you to do so.**

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.
**By adding the appropriate `else` conditions. The program generally reads from top-to-bottom and will print the first result that meets the appropriate conditions.**

1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?
**The logical operators `&&` and `||` can help with this. `&&` checks to see if both conditions are met while `||` checks if at least one or the other condition is met.**

1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
**None at the moment, but I'm sure I'll have plenty more soon!**
