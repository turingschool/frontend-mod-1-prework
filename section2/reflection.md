## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

-I have lived many years not asking the "dumb question" because I did not want to appear incompetent. I always felt I had something to prove and also always felt that I lacked what I needed and wanted to gain that on my own. That feeling of being an imposter wasted an incredible amount of my time. As a result, I have gotten better at asking the dumb questions and feeling more confident in my skin, but I am well-aware that my default setting is to seek the answer myself and "prove" to others I am "capable". The final blog post really spoke to the value of time. It resonated with me that it is dumber to spend hours seeking the answer to a dumb question rather than simply asking it and moving on quickly when a superior or colleague knows the answer.

2. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?
-I wasn't using node to check my work. Previously, I couldn't figure it out and used the console in my web browser. Using node really forced me to check my work THROUGHOUT the lesson and was more efficient in the end. Additionally, using the outside sources forced me to do a little more googling, which felt more like it would if I were in a job as a developer not having the support of a lesson to use as a crutch.

3. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.
-A conditional statement is a command that executes if certain comparisons are true or false.
-For example: I may create a conditional statement around when it is or is not appropriate to work at home. If my toddler is awake I can work from home if  my husband is there to help. If my toddler is home and sleeping, then I can work from home. If my toddler is awake and my husband is gone, then I cannot work from home because I need to be with my toddler and cannot focus meaningfully on my work.
-A conditional is probably used in Quizziz. In this app, students are asked questions and have multiple possible answers (like a quiz). If a student answers a question correctly, then they will be asked the next question. If a student answers incorrectly, they will be asked the following question, but REASKED the incorrect answer again at the end of the series.

4. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.
-multiple conditions can be added to an `if` statement by using a block of code when their condition evaluates to `true`. Using `else if` and `else` allows for additional conditions to be evaluated.

5. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?
If I want to check that two conditions are met I can use the `&&` function (Logical AND). If I want to check the 1 of 2 conditions are met, I can use the `||` function (logical OR).

5. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
I am struggling to execute the `&&` statements in the if-statements exercise. I have made a personal note to revise this lesson and investigate my syntax further.
