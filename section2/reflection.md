## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?
I tend to not ask questions soon enough. Usually once I'm more comfortable in a setting, I feel comfortable asking questions much sooner however.

1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?
It felt like having the rug pulled out from under me at first, but I adapted quickly and started finding my own sources for topics I didn't fully understand. Since it is impossible to learn everything about javascript from a 7 month course, being confident in filling my own gaps of knowledge in will be crucial.

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.
A conditional statement is a line of code that when run, reaches a boolean conclusion. An example of a daily life conditional is, "If I eat lunch, I will be less hungry.". A web app could use a conditionals to check if a username and password match their database. If it does, it allows the user to log in, if not, it throws an error message.

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.
To add multiple conditions to an 'if' statement, you use 'else if'. The program looks at each statement and finds which one evaluates to true based on the variable that is attached to it.

1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code
To check that 2 conditions are met, you use '&&' which checks that condition 1 and condition 2 are both true. If you want to check if 1 of conditions is met, you use '||'.

1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
It seems like "if statements" could easily become quite large depending on the application. I wonder if they are the most efficient way of executing these kind of statements or if there is another way.
