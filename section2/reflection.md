## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

_I tend to wait too long before asking questions, but I have gotten better about this over the years working at a tech company. I was once timid about it and I've definitely been in the situation where I've asked too soon or realized my own answer in the process of formulating the question._

1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

_Running a file in node was not entirely new to me and it was still fresh in my mind from the previous section, so I was not off-put by that in this scenario. The material shared for functions was very adequate and shows us that additional training and learning resources are readily available regarding these concepts._

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

_A conditional statement allows your code to make decisions about what to do next. A real life conditional could be that "if fridge is empty", then you must go to the grocery store; conversely, you don't need to go to the grocery store if your fridge is full. In my Gmail inbox, I have it set up to put my unread messages on the top; so, the conditional is "if message status is unread, then the program show message up top."_

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

_If you need to add multiple conditions to an `if` statement, you should use `if...else` statements. If you have more than two conditions, you can go with a `if/ else if/ else` structure to your statement. The program will read these conditionals top-down and only run the applicable code block if the condition evaluates to true. If a condition is not met or does not evaluate to true, the program will check the next condition._

1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

_You can use logical operators like AND & OR to check in on multiple conditions simultaneously._

1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?

_The learning material has mentioned there are multiple ways to declare functions, when should we use one method over another?_
_Is there situations where it is beneficial to practice hoisting your function declarations?_
