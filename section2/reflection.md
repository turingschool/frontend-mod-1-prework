## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?


  I do not like asking questions, but I do not mind googling things to find an answer. Generally I wait too long to ask but I've been trying to remind myself lately to ask google if I'm stuck at all.

1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?


I didn't have any problems with the way we learned things in this section. I actually had run into a problem last section with trying to figure out running things in node, so I was already clear on how to do that. I took my time learning the concepts in this section and enjoyed the different kinds of explanations from different sources.

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.


Conditional statements are *if*, *else*, *else if* or *switch* statements in code used to perform different actions based on different conditions. A daily life conditional would be having eggs for breakfast *if* the chickens laid an egg, or *else* we would have oatmeal. A way these would be used on a website would be if the website was greeting you with good morning, good afternoon or good evening. They would use the *if* and *else* conditional statements, along with the time of day, to figure out a greeting to the user.

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.


You can add multiple conditions by doing one *if* statement and then adding *else* statements to make multiple conditions. The program would start by reading the first *if* statement and continue to the next statement if the first *if* statement was not true. The program would continue reading through each *else* statement until is read a true statement and then it would return that value.



1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?


You can use comparison operators and logical operators to check if different conditions are met.

1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?


How do I run functions inside of conditionals?
