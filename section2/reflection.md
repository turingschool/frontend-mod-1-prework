## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

I know that I am typically comfortable asking questions because I am here to learn, not to pretend like I am already an expert. However, as one post described, I have found myself overthinking whether or not to ask a question during Mod 0 because I don't want to appear unskilled or unintelligent. However, I am working on pushing myself to remember that I am in this program because I intend to learn and understand what I am doing. If I didn't care about my educational process, I wouldn't be here. That is helping me push aside the embarrassment and ask questions frequently, though strategically. I find that I am fall in the "waiting too long" side of asking questions. I find that I enjoy the process of trying to figure something out, but I don't shy away from asking for help if I am too far into a search to no avail.


1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

While it was slightly daunting at first to have to explore other resources, it
was helpful in my learning process. I learn from understanding why I'm doing what
I'm doing. As for running a file in node, it helped me take a step back and figure out
what I need to type to achieve the same results and why, without just being tempted to
copy and paste. Having to explore other resources also helped me connect the kind of information I would have to search on my own.

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

A conditional statements allow for the computer to figure out whether we need it to do one thing or another. An application that likely uses conditional statements is a bank account: when requesting to transfer money,
it may ask whether you want to deposit to one account or another.

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

You can add multiple conditions to an `if` statement by including various else code blocks. The program reads the initial conditions, and determines if that is the `true`, in which case it results in that evaluation. If the initial condition is not met, and it is false, the following else code blocks instructs it to move to the next option.   

1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

A tool available are logical operators. Logical operators to connect the two variables within a single condition. Logical operators like `&&` or `||` presents the two variables to be compared and then helps determine if the condition results in the expected evaluation.


1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?

I still have questions about functions, as I was least comfortable with that content. However, I am still working on finishing the CodeAcademy lesson, and know that will help in my understanding.
