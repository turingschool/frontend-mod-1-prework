## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

-I believe I'm in between.  Sometimes I ask too early and find out we will be covering the material later.  Sometimes I ask too late, or not at all.  

1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

-At first it was confusing.  I looked at previous lessons thinking it was covered and I missed it.  But I soon realized this is how we learn in the real world.  Sometimes things aren't taught and I have to search for the answer myself.  The manager will not teach you everything in a real job setting.  It is up to you to research and find the answers to be able to succeed.

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

-Conditional statements are if else statements.  It basically checks if a condition is true. If it is the code executes.  If not it goes to the next condition and checks.  It keeps repeating until either a condition is true or else if all are false a final code executes.
A daily life conditional would be if it is hot outside.  If it is you would wear shorts.  If not you would wear pants.
A web application that uses conditionals would be Netflix.  If your username and password are correct(true) then you can browse the movies.  If not you cannot enter the site.

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

-To add multiple conditions you would use and(&&) or or(||).  And would be used to check if both conditions are true.  If both are true the whole statement would be true.  If one is false the whole statement is false.  Or would be used if either one condition or the other is true.  If one is true the whole statement is true.

1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

-The And(&&) operator checks if two conditions are met.  The Or(||) operator checks if just one of two operations are met.

1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?

None
