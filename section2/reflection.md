## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?
  - Most of the time it's somewhere in between, sometimes I tend to wait a while before asking however.

1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?
  - It wasn't uncomfortable for the most part, I did run npm instead of node for the first time and was a little confused then looked it up.

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.
  1. Whether or not to make coffee in the morning
  2. whether or not a user in logged in to a site

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.
  - For adding multiple conditions to an if statement you use `elseif` for each condition you need.

1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?
  - && is true if both conditions are true
  - || is true if either condition is true

1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
  - What advantages does a switch statement have over and if statement?
