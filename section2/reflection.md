## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

  I feel comfortable asking questions, sometimes I tend to ask too soon, but I've been working more on that, Trying to understand first, and trying to find the answer on my own before asking. I'm definitely sure that questions are great to save time, and enrich your own work, by adding the input and experience of others into your suitcase.

2. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

   It felt **great**, like the child that doesn't need to hold the parents hands. It was pleasant to find information and see how it clicks with the information acquired previously. And then use it with new goals. Feels like real life, where nothing is handed to you, where you need to get out there and get what you need.

3. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

   Conditional statements are commands for handling decisions, it says what to do in a given situation.
   An example of a daily life conditional statement could be when we check the weather before leaving our house, we think, if t's cold then I would wear a jacket.
   An example where probably can be used on a web application is when we fill a required field on a web application, if it doesn't have the proper format (like for the case of an email) or if it's empty, it will prompts us to go back and fill it properly.

4. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

   I do this through the command `else if`, what the program does to read it is to go in order, from the first conditional `if` if it resolves to *true* the code block associated with this conditional is ran, if evaluates to *false* the program checks the next conditional `else if` until it evaluates to *true* and runs the code block associated with that conditional.

5. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

   I have available the logical operator `&&` and `OR`.

6. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?

   The information I have until now it's very clear or precise, more than questions I need more practice for this to be more than knowledge and information on my head, to transform it into experience and second nature.
