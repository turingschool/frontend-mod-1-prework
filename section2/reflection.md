## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

I feel like I am right in the middle. Sometimes I feel like I've given up too early to find that the answer was so obvious. On the other hand, i feel hesitant to ask questions when I feel like I should know the answer.

1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

For me it was a bit of a review. I've already been studying basic javascript on and off for the last year. I am curious how it would have been going into the section with no prior knowledge. I could tell the information felt further than section 1 but I will able to fill in the gaps pretty easily. Even though I wrote in my notebook for all of this, I still think it was thin compared to what it would've been had I knew nothing of javascript. I mostly wrote about terms and keywords so that I can reference them later, but I didn't feel the need to make diagrams or examples. I am sure the program will surpass my knowledge soon and this will change.

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

Conditional statement are statements in the code that sets a true or false condition to determine if the code should execute the code block or continue running.
If I wake up early enough, I can make coffee before work. If I don't wake up early enough, I can't make coffee.
There was a betting website that I used a long time ago, where the more money you entered the higher your chances of winning were. I imagine for each dollar you entered will go through conditional statements until it finally settles on a true and that will be your percentage of winning.

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

You can add more than on condition to an `if` statement by `else if` and `else` statements. If the first conditional returns false, then the code will continue to the next condition with the `else if` statements. This can repeat until either the condition is met or until it reaches the `else` statement. Once it reaches the `else` statement, the code block will execute. This is because all of the other conditionals were false.

1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

You can add more than on condition to an `if` statement by using logical operators (|| and &&). || is the or statement. This will allow the code block to execute if the condition from either side is true. The && operator requires both conditions to be true in order for the code to execute.


1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?

No questions.
