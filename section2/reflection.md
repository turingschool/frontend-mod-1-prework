## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

I feel comfortable asking questions. I've done all three, though I've learned that waiting too long to ask tends to be most detrimental to my learning.

2. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

It felt fine. I've found it useful to reference various resources when learning; it sometimes helps to hear the same material in different way. It wasn't uncomfortable, rather, it supported my learning by giving me a chance to practice skills I'll use as a web developer.

3. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

A conditional statement sets conditions or requirements that must be fulfilled for a follow-on action to execute. An example from daily life would be: If it's cool outside, then I'll wear a jacket. An example of a conditional in a web application would be if the user inputs a password that's too short, the program displays a message prompting the user to change their password to meet the length requirement.

4. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

You follow the initial `if` statement with `else if` or `else` statements. The interpreter will read the first `if` statement, and, if the conditions are met, execute the code inside the statement. If the conditions aren't met, the interpreter will go to the next `else` or `else if` statement. If it's an `else if` statement and its conditions are met, the interpreter will execute the code inside the statement. If it's an `else` statement, the interpreter will execute the code inside the statement.

5. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

I can use the `&&` operator to check that two conditions are met, and I can use the `||` operator to check if one of two conditions is met.

6. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?

How many conditions can you include in a single if statement?
