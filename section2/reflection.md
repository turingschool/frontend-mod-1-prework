## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?  
The readings reassured me once again, that everyone will ask questions and that's ok! I need to reteach myself when the best time to ask questions is.  I have found I ask questions to my peers too early.  I get frustrated and just ask for the easy way out, then usually before they answer I have already found the solution.  I need to get comfortable with being uncomfortable for a bit longer before reaching out.  I definitely do not have an issue with asking questions to my peers, though. No shame here!  I like the idea of explaining things out to a rubber ducky on my desk. I find I do talk to myself when coding.  I'll ask myself "what am I trying to accomplish right now? What do I need this code to do?" I find it helps!  

1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?  
It was definitely uncomfortable and frustrating.  But it's also exciting! I love puzzles, so it was fun to try to make my code work.  Nothing more exhilarating than when it finally works!  Also, reading the error messages in my code was very, very helpful, and got me unstuck several times.

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.  
A conditional statement tells the computer what to run based on information its provided.  So if one criteria is true, then perform this.  If it's not true, move on to the next statement and stop when it's true and do that.  Libraries may use this to say if today's date is after due date, then display "BOOK OVERDUE".  When I try to cancel a membership, it opens up many more windows based on how I respond.  For example, do you want to cancel? yes or no. I click no.  The website then displays are you sure? What if you get this discount? I say no. And so on. It's similar to the bear and the hat/scarf story, where the path unfolds as you go through it step by step.

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.  
What helped me most is the realization that the computer starts with the first if statement, and goes down one at a time until it finds the true statement, then stops.  I originally thought the computer looked at all the options at once.  Once I understood that, if statements became easier.  The conditions are if blank, else if blank, (as many else if's as needed), and finally else to encompass all other possible answers.

1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?  
I'm not sure I understand this question.  We can use node in the terminal or repl.it to test out code, but that's running the code, so I assume that's not what you mean?  I look at the code itself because it changes colors and sort of prompts me as I write it in atom, which helps clue me in to whether I'm writing code correctly or not.  I try to proofread before I run to increase my chances of success.  

1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?  
I don't know if I have questions persay, but I definitely need more practice with all of it.  When mod1 prework is submitted and before mod1 starts, I will take as many javascript courses as I can!
