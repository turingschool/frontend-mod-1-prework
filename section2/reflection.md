## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?
~ *I think I strike a fairly good balance, although I may tend towards researching/experimenting on my own just a smidge longer than is
   optimal. I thoroughly enjoy the challenge of sitting with some problem and breaking it down to see if I can put it back together again,
   and tend to reserve asking for help for when it seems that I've "waded too far from shore".*

2. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?
~ *I was already familiar with all the concepts covered in this section (thanks to Codecademy!). I don't always get the right
   answers, of course, but I am comfortable with the material. However, I was not at all familiar with doing git work from the terminal, nor
   with GitHub, so those two things have been a bit awkward.
  I don't know that any part of learning it was uncomfortable, necessarily, but it was a little "concerning" at times. As mentioned above, I
   like to play around with things to see if I can figure out how they work/tick on my own, and several experiments I did revolving around
   gits, repo's, gists, GitHub and other such things went very poorly, and at times I thought I had really screwed up my computer, or at
   least my ability to work.
  Programs were giving errors I had not seen anyone else ask about, my terminal kept giving me these "urgent" warnings, etc, and it
   was a bit...much. I was able to figure things out, though, with some vital help from the study group, and it turned out I was
   overcomplicating things. So, moving forward, I will be more careful to keep any problems/errors I encounter in their proper perspective,
   slow myself down, take a breath and solve the issue, step by step.*

3. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.
~ *If I have get off work early, I can watch veg out or I can study. If it's true that I want to become a programmer, then study it is!*
  *I enjoy my YouTube time. I use it half for entertainment, half for learning/research (roughly). A conditional probably used by YouTube
   is "if timestamp is at **x** *play midroll advert".*

4. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how the program reads them and determines what to do.
~ *After the "if" statement, all other conditionals will be labeled "else if", except for the final conditional which will be labeled "else".
   The more "else if's" you add, the greater the number of conditionals.
  The program reading the code will begin by reading the first conditional (the "if" statement). If this statement satisfies the given
   conditional, the code block enclosed within this conditional will execute and the program will ignore all remaining conditionals up
   until (and including) the next "else" conditional in the block. The program will then pick up reading the code immediately following
   that last "else" conditional.
  If the statement within the first conditional does not satisfy that conditional, the next conditional in line is run to determine whether
   or not the statement within that conditional satisfies it. This process continues until a statement is found that satisfies the
   conditional, upon which the program ignores all proceeding conditionals (up to, and including, the next "else" conditional) and picks up reading code from there.*

5. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?
~ *I can use the logical operators && (and) or || (or).*

6. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
~ *I'm intrigued to learn just how complicated they can get, when it comes to passing in parameters/arguments and such, and when nesting
   nesting them inside layers of code...I'm excited to find out!
