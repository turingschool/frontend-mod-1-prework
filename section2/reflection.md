## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

*I'm not very good yet asking technical questions in the right way.I know I will became better during Turing, I've already bought my rubber duck, so it will be easier for me to remember to pay more attention to how to ask the questions in a better way.*

*When I'm not comfortable with the environment, all is very new. I have a tendency of not asking questions. Usually I watch first and latter on I get more comfortable with the new people around, new vocabulary and for sure I will start asking more questions.I don't stay stuck for too long because I don't like to waist my time, but usually my wrong is wait too long, or trying for about 2 hours before asking for help ( this includes a time to walk around and refresh my mind).*   

1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

*I feel Turing is teaching me how to be independent, self learning. I know the software industry do not stop, so I truly believe I'm being prepared for reality.*

*it is not the way I've grown up learning, but this way improves my curiosity, my will to understand and for some reason looks like it is faster to learn.*

*If you ask me if I prefer a teacher telling me everything :- yes, But if you ask me: how do you learn faster: -By doing it myself. This is a hard balance, but i believe i have the right mindset for how i'm learning with Turing, and also I'm trying to enjoy the whole process as much as I can.At the end, it is fun to be able to do those things without too much support.There's a feeling of accomplishment and competency.*   

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

*A Conditional statement says what to do in a given situation.(if/else if/else) Ex of daily life conditional: If I have time I will cook my lunch tomorrow, but if i Don't have time to cook then I will eat at a restaurant. But If I'm not able to go to the restaurant and don't have time to cook I will buy food to be delivered.*

*I use postmates to buy food, so when I look for restaurants they ask for my zip code, and in response they show me a list of restaurants close to my house. I believe they use a conditional to decide what restaurants will be shown to me*   

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

*I would use Logical operators. What I've learned for now is I would use ADD &&, or OR || in between the conditions. The ADD && operator will be read as a boolean: True or false statements, and will only return TRUE when both conditions are TRUE ( in all other cases it will return false).*

*The OR || operator will be read as a boolean as well, but it will only return FALSE when both conditions are FALSE (in all other cases it will return TRUE).*

1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

*I can use the If statements, with the condition operators where I'm able to check separately if each condition is met, and add ( ADD ""&&""/ OR ""||"") the Logical Operator with the if statements to check if 2 conditions are met before running a block of code.*

1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?

*How many logical operator exist?*
*What is Toggle?*
*I don't think I understand very well the logical operators, I definitely could use a class on this topic with more exercises about it to be able to understand its behavior*
