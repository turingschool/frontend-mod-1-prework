## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?
- It felt grasping for what I had to do next. Reverting back to what I did before. It established to what I had to put to memory.
1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.
- The variable to the whole broad statement. A conditional to my life is if I get my daughter to daycare on time, if I get to work on time.
1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.
After each if or else statment.
1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?
- Checking on the console.
1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
- Being able to knownigly put them where they should go.
