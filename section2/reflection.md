## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

*I am pretty hesitant when it comes to asking questions unless it takes me 30+ minutes to find the solution or answer.  I tend to wait too long to ask questions and it's not the fact of asking a dumb question or how, it is more of me thinking that I can find the answer.  This is probably the worst way to approach things in terms of coding because I know that I am just beginning this journey and it is not a contest. Time is valuable!*

1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

*I actually did not refer back to section one and I googled how to do it first.  I don't remember what website popped up or if it was a Youtube video that I referred to that taught me but it felt very natural to Google how to do it.*

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

A conditional statement says what to do in a given situation.  It is based on a concept of if/then/else. A conditional statement is probably used in Fantasy Sport applications (football, basketball).  If A has more points then B this week, Give A the win and B the loss; or if A and B tie in points, give them a tie.

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

*Adding multiple conditions would look something like so below*
if ((dollars == 1) && (gum == 3)) {
  "you need more dollars"
}; else (); {
  "You can afford gum"
}

*The program checks a conditions based off of variables to see if it is true or false. If the condition evaluates as true, the code in the first curly bracket will be executed and if evaluates as false, the program will go on to the next block of code in the next curly bracket.*

1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?
 *You can use the IF and ELSE conditional statements and using the return and print statements*


1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
*Sometimes I ran a code and there would be an infinite amount of values outputted in the terminal and I'd have to force quit out.  I was wondering why this happens?*
