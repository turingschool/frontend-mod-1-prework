## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

- I feel like I am somehwere in between waiting too long or asking too soon. I have found that when I wait right as I ask or am about to ask I found the answer for myself. When I ask too soon I usually just don't know enough about the issue and need to do more research. 

1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

- As this isn't my frist time with functions and if statements I felt very comfortable. However I would like to say when I first started learning javascript I felt pretty confused at first and it took a decent ammount of practice to feel comfortable. I had to do a lot of research as I was self taught so I was forced to put myself into uncomfortable positions to find success. 

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

#### Life exmaple
+ My Pet Rat
```javascript 
If my rat wants attention he will ring his bell
    Otherwise he will sleep or eat food
```

#### Web Application
+ Youtube Login
```javascript
If the password matches your account password grant login
If not say "Wrong Password!"
```

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

To add multiple conditions you would say "else if". The way the program reads them and determines what to do is like this

+ if whatever condition is set evaluatues to being true then it will run the first code block

```javascript
if it is false and there is an else if, it will evaluate that condtion. If it is true it will run that code block. 
this repeats until either a code block has been run, or there are no more if statements to check. 
```

1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

- There is the "&&" which means both conditions need to be true in order for the code block to run. There is also the "||" which means 1 of th 2 conditions need to be true in order for the code block to run. 

1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?

- I feel very confident in both of these topics and currently do not have any questions about them.
