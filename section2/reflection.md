## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

- I am trying to figure out the balance of when/how to ask a question.  At first, I was ashamed to ask a question because I thought people would think I wasn't smart.  After being in Mod 0 for a bit and reading about the appropriate ways to ask questions, I try to solve things on my own, but if I am completely stumped I will reach out for help.   

1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

- Without direction, I have found that I am second guessing everything I do.  It is uncomfortable because I want to learn the material correctly, and I am not sure if I am.  It is also making me feel a little uncomfortable turning in my work because I don't like sharing my work when it may not be correct.  The discomfort is pushing me to research and really dig into concepts until I think I have a grasp on them.  It is also encouraging me to reach out to classmates for help.   

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

- Conditional statements are used in code to perform different actions for different decisions...  these statements are based on if/then/else.  A daily life conditional for me is if I wake up hungry I will eat breakfast... this evaluates to true.  If I am not hungry I will just have a cup of coffee.  On my Fierce45 app, they probably use a conditional to either let you sign up for a class (if you have passes left) or take you to the Buy More Passes page (if you are out of passes).  

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

- You can add multiple conditions to an `if` statement by using `else if`.  If the `if` statement is true, the computer will execute the code in the curly bracket.  If the `if` statement is false, the `else if` tells the computer to test the new condition.  The `else` statement is used if all of the other conditions return false.  

1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

- If you want to check that TWO conditions are met, you would use the logical operator &&.  && only returns true when both of its operands are true.  

- If you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, you would use the logical operator ||.  || only returns false when both of it operands are false.  

1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?

- I am still confused about the logical operators.  In the if-statements exercise, "For the last two exercises, an ideal solution probably uses a logical operator" is throwing me off.  I am curious why a logical operator is the best solution for the gum ball question.
