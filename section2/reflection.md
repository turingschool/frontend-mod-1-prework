## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?
   * I tend to wait too long to ask questions. Specifically with this program and the emphasis on "google it and figure it out" I'm operating under the assumption that all the answers are available to me on the internet so as long as I dig hard enough.

2. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?
    * I prefer clearer expectations. Learning node was a simple enough google search, plus we saw it in use several times during Try Coding and MOD 0 courses. During my MOD 0 assessment I did a lot of googling and made my solutions more complicated than they needed to be. I'm teetering on a fine line with these assignments of not over complicating my code, and trying to follow the instructions and expected outcomes exactly. This requires *a lot* of trial and error. I'm used to a more traditional teaching style of learning a little bit at a time in a sequence, versus self discovery and analyzing why the code does or doesn't work. I'll adapt, but it's definitely a challenge.

3. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.
    * A conditional statement determines what code is run through the process of elimination in "if" statements.
    * One example of a daily life conditional would be if I complete this MOD 1 Prework then I attend Turing. If I do not complete MOD 1 Prework, then I repeat and pass MOD 0. If I don't do either, I get kicked out of the program.
    * A web application example would be on Zillow. If I select a square footage parameter, and price parameter than my search is returned with those parameters filtering my listings. If I don't select any parameters than my search is returned with all listings.

4. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how the program reads them and determines what to do.
    * Multiple conditions are added to `if` statements using additional `else if` arguments. The program reads them in order and decides if it moves on to the next if statement based on if the previous ones were false. Once a statement is true, the program pushes out the answer.

5. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?
    * Logical operators

6. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
    * I need more practice with logical operators.
