## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

+ I lean towards the the latter category of waiting too long to ask a question. This is a combination of working up _'the nerve'_ to ask a question which can feel very vulnerable, as well as wanting to give myself the space to work through it on my own. I should learn to be aware of where I am with a problem which will help me to determine the best path forward. Also, being cognizant of how to ask a question effectively will likely calm the nerves of asking the question. I think the 20-30 minute window of trying to figure it out before asking a question will be a very helpful rule of thumb going forward.

1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

+ This felt fine for the most part. I was able to reference steps I've taken in section 1, and also had a chance to practice my googling skills. The most uncomfortable part was sussing out how deep to dive on researching a topic I needed clarity on. Resources like MDN are quite thorough in scope. Trying to glean enough info to make it work without overloading my brain with stuff I didn't understand/didn't need to know was quite a challenge. It is helping my learning process by making that sort of quick research part of my workflow rather than a detour from my workflow (I hope that makes sense!)

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

+ It is a simple criteria that tells a computer how and when to do either one thing or another thing.

In real life this could be something like _if_ you have brushed your teeth _then_ you can go to bed. _If_ you have not brushed your teeth, _then_ you cannot go to bed yet.

In a web application a conditional statement could be _if_ username and password match what is on file, _then_ you can have access to your emails.

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how the program reads them and determines what to do.

+ Multiple conditions are added to if statements by using the **else if** and **else** statements.
The program will work down the line starting with the first _if_ statement. If it determines it to be _true_ the program can run. If it determines it to be _false_ it will jump to the next _else if_ statement and determine it to be _true or false_. The last statement which should cover all other conditions is the **else** statement.

1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

+ for this we can use _logical operators_ to determine if two conditions are met (&&) or if one of two conditions are met (||)

1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?

+ It seems that _if statements_ have the potential to get very complex as they weave in and out of different sections of code. Is there a _best practice_ for making sure that an if statement or function doesn't screw up something way down the line?
