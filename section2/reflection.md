## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

I feel like I wait too long sometimes, but so far I have been able to figure roadblocks out myself at a reasonable rate.

1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

I like that it builds the muscle memory I need to learn a coding language. That in addition to repetition really helps build a strong foundation. It was a bit uncomfortable for the functions exercise at first when it asked to show a sum of two parameters. I kept getting 1+2=12 when trying to log the sum. I searched that one on Google for awhile, and the answer was pretty simple. It helped my Googling skills and to remember to keep it simple.

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

A conditional statement is a statement, when run, that returns a true or false value. "Am I Hungry?" returns a "yes" or "no". I think Facebook might use conditionals for reactions, if they are clicked, the reaction sends, otherwise, the reaction does not send.

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

You use the `else if` statement to add additional conditions to an `if` statement. If the condition for the `if` statement is false, and the `else if` is true, then the block of code under the `else if` is run.

1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?
I think that logical operators like AND (&&) and OR (||) are useful in helping with this task.

1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?

I'm wondering if I did functions part two, the question with the sum correctly. Also, when we want to log a variable in between scripts we can use both concatenation AND interpolation right?
