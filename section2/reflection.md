## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?
-  I tend to wait too long to ask questions. I enjoy trying to figure them out on my own. But I'm getting better about it, and I love that at Turing I have so many people I can lean on.
1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?
- I enjoy having to search for information on my own. Working harder to learn something makes me feel like I end up having a better understanding of what the subject is.
1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.
- If your condition evaluates to true it will run a code. You can setup multiple conditions that the code will read until one evaluates to true.
- A daily life conditional would be like "If I show up to work late, then my boss is mad"
- A web application could use a conditional to to say if I input the correct log in information it will proceed to my homepage, and if I entered wrong information it'll send me to a page helping me recover log in information.
1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.
- You can use "else if" to create multiple conditions. The program will run each condition until one evaluates to true.
1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?
- You can use logical operators "&&" and "||". You'd use "&&" to make sure both conditons are true. Or use "||" to ensure that one of the two conditions are true.
1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
- I don't have any questions currently, but I am excited to see how I can use this new knowledge to create more complex code.
