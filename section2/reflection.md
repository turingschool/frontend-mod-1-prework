## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

  As I become more familiar with the material, asking questions becomes more comfortable. To paraphrase a point from Eric's gist, "If you're not sure what question to even ask, then you aren't ready to ask a question. I think that pretty much sums up my experience for the first week and half. It was a little overwhelming, and I felt a little behind. By the time I had a specific enough question, it was too late to ask. I think the more in sync the students get with other students, the more relevant the questions will be, which, in turn, will create more engagement from the students on platforms like Slack.

  Now, if I could just learn how to _answer_ questions...

2. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

  Surprisingly, I felt very engaged and excited about the work done in this section. I was able to write most statements without referencing too much outside of my notes. I really enjoyed thinking about how to write code more efficiently, and how to go beyond the first solution that came to mind. These exercises have helped me become more aware of where my weaknesses and strengths lie, and how to attune them.

3. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

  A conditional statement executes different actions based on whether a condition is true or false.  

  Daily Example: If I am alive, then I am not dead.

  Web Application Example: Buying plane tickets. If I choose "one-way" then there will not be a return date field, if I choose "round-trip," a return date will be asked for.

4. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

  You use the `else if` statement. The code will run through each statement until it reaches a `true` statement, At that point it will skip over to the next code block, and ignore the the rest of the statements in the current code block. If none `true`, then it will reach the `else` statement at the end and execute the instructions found there.  


5. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

  Logical Operators `&&` (Logical And Operation) and `||` (Logical Or Operation) can be used to check if two conditions being met, or one of two conditions are met.

6. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?

  __Update__ Much like the previous section's reflections, most of these are now irrelevant!

  Most of the questions I have can be answered with a quick google search, but...

  I was curious as to why in `if else` statements apostrophes `''` are sometimes used to wrap text or strings, and other times `""` are used.

  I am eager to learn when functions are called before declaration

  I __THINK__ I understand why the logical operator question (lovesToPlay + age) at the end of the comparison exercise yields a `1`
