## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

I feel comfortable asking questions for the most part. I'm somewhere in between too soon and too long. I like to make notes on questions I might have, then see if I still have them when the class or meeting is over. I'm a very curious person, so I've definitely caught myself falling down the Google rabbit hole at times.

2. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

So far, I've really enjoyed how this section was structured. It gave us just enough information, and then gave us multiple sources to consult for a deeper understanding, and exercises to fiddle around and figure it out. I had already committed the basic directory navigation commands to memory, as well as how to run a file. I went back to section1 to review how to save my work in Git, and how to push the files to GitHub. I will probably continue to keep that section1 up as a reference for the next few days until I feel confident that I've got the commands down. One thing I noticed is the section1 reflection assignment file is misspelled (relection.md) - a clever lesson in paying attention to detail - and it did catch me off guard initially when saving the file in Git for the first time.

3. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

A conditional statement is an expression that evaluates to either true or false - using "if, if/else statements". These conditions may help direct the flow of a program....like the bear hat/scarf story.

Daily life conditional:
If the weather is nice, I will go for a long walk.

Web application:
Food delivery apps saw a lot of my business in 2020. I think an example of a conditional on an app like GrubHub is a time of day/night conditional. If the current time is before/after a certain time, the app will show closed options and a message that says something like, "No stores are open at this time."

4. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

An "if" statement with additional if/else statements will allow multiple conditions to be given to the program, presenting multiple routes a program can take depending on what conditions are met/are true. To add multiple conditions, there is a single space after your last close curly brace, then "else or else if" with an open curly brace (no space) followed by the console.log patten. When presented with multiple conditions, a program will read each one until it reads a condition that evaluates as true. It will stop and follow that condition instruction.  

5. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

The && and || logical operators:
&& checks that both conditions are true
|| checks that one of two conditions is true

6. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?

I had a question on the functions exercise, in "PART 1: Function Syntax" the first example places a semicolon after the close curly brace. I did not follow that pattern. Should the final curly brace have a semicolon immediately after?
