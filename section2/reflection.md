## Section 2 Reflection

*1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?*

I have a really hard time asking questions. I think some of this has to do with my lack of confidence and not wanting to look silly or as though I don't know anything. I'm probably closer to the wait too long camp. Sometimes I don't ask questions because it just doesn't seem necessary, as though in my mind I think I'll eventually come across the information I need, or will be able to look it up if I don't understand something.

*1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?*

I found this section to be more challenging in the technical exercises. The material is so non-intuitive, and connecting the concepts to anything real-world has been difficult. It's helpful that the exercises are interspersed with the reading and videos, like a short teaching session followed by a practical session. It helped things sink in a little bit.

*1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.*

A conditional statement will require that certain things be true in order to proceed to the next task, and often present in the form of an "if...then" statement. In daily life, one should brush their teeth at least twice a day. Bedtime could be conditional upon a check for clean teeth.

`If teeth are not brushed, then you cannot go to bed.`

On a web site, logging into an account would be conditional, requiring a correct username and password before access is granted.

`if password is incorrect, return a message, "Wrong password - try again"`

*1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.*

To add multiple conditions to an `if` statement, you would also want to have an `else if` or `else` statement. This will tell the script to run through each condition until a true statement is found, and then return that statement as output.

*1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?*

Logical operators can be used to check two conditions. If you want to ensure *both* conditions are met, the AND operator `&&` is used. To check that one or the other condition is `true`, the OR operator "||" is used and will return either condition if true.

*1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?*

I think I just need to practice writing these out to understand all the pieces. Is there a place that presents exercises? Or I could complete the Codecademy lesson on functions, is that a good route to take? :)
