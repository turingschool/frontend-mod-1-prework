## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?
- I tend to wait a while to ask questions. A lot of the time I feel like I understand something, try to implement it, then when I hit a snag I get a clearer idea of what I don't understand. I don't mind asking questions though.  I think it's because I've been through so much school, I've lost a lot of the ingrained embarrassment. Since starting to code, I have run into a lot of really (dumb) simple mistakes like misspelling a work by one letter or forgetting an underscore. So I do tend to wait a little and play with the until I can figure it out. Because of my usual process, I like the 20 minute rule! This gives me some structure so I don't waste time if I'm going in the wrong direction, but I also don't reach out too early.

1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?
- This was definitely a little uncomfortable, but I also know I'm going to run into this more and more in this field. So, I feel like I'm getting a little more comfortable using Google to find help/answers. I will be honest, I noticed an instructor use node <file name> in one of the mod 0 sessions, so I didn't have to Google that one. But, I did have a harder time with the exercises and I had to look up a little more than I did in section1. In academia (and really high school), you're often taught to use the required books and not to rely on Google or other online sources to help you. Many times, you're highly discouraged from doing this. I suppose this is when adopting a growth mindset is beneficial. I first need to unlearn what I was taught around this, which is the uncomfortable part I think, then relearn that looking up answers/guides/help is ok and encouraged.

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.
- A conditional statement tells us what to do if something is true or false. In daily life, we can see this everywhere. One example is "If I have on a mask" then "I can enter this store". (Some people are confused by this, but it really is that simple!) In a web application, we could see this as: "If you are logged in with your email and password" then "You can add items to your wishlist and cart".

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.
- If we have multiple conditions, we would use an if/ifelse/else statement. So, we'd have our first if statement with a condition and a second, third, and so on if else conditions with additional criteria each. Then a final else if none of the previous if statements are true. So the program would start at the first if and work its way down each if else statement until one condition results in true.

1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?
- If the code is really simple, it's relatively easy to look at the variable's value to check ourself. But in most cases, we will want to make sure our code will work and our code might be more complicated. We could always use a site or app like repl.it where we can play with our code and check for any bugs. We can upload files or even just take small code snippets to test without it affecting our actual code.

1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
- Should our last else statement not include any parameters ever? Are there ever any cases where the if and the else statement both have parameters (not including the if/ifelse/else statement, just for the regular if/else)?
