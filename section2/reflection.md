## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?  

   +I believe that I often wait a little too long to ask a question. I can be very shy (I was **incredibly** shy in my youth) and it has taken many years to work my way out of that shy place. I have learned over the years, though, that I often lose out when I don't just swallow my pride and ask my question.  
   +I liked the tips about continuing to work on a problem as long as you're making progress (even if you're getting different error messages, this is still progress/change), then research for 20-30 minutes, and **THEN** ask your question. This is a framework that makes a lot of sense to me and I think I can utilize this.  
   +I really liked the pointers, in the section on asking questions about getting more comfortable about asking questions in our public, cohort specific group. It was a nice reminder that if you're struggling with something, someone else probably is too. It also is a better use of an instructor's time: to answer the question for everyone to see, instead of answering the same question over and over again in direct messages. **Also**, this gives students a chance to troubleshoot together and help each other out.  

1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?  

   +I actually **LOVED** it! I like taking off the training wheels and really enjoy typing/wading around inside of my text editor and my terminal. I get a sort of high from it, especially when you just seem to understand the lesson material so well and everything clicks. It was fun playing around and just seeing if different things would work or not. I also feel like my confidence is growing in my terminal and I'm dusting off my typing skills (they were getting a little rusty).  
   +I didn't find much that was uncomfortable about it. There was a slight moment, when I opened the first .js file in section2, where I felt this self-doubt sneaking in and I felt like my heart started wanting to beat a little faster. I just dove in and tried to push past that feeling and then I felt really capable. It was exhilarating. It makes me feel all the more that this is what I want to do.  

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.  

   +Conditional statements evaluate/compare situations and give us an outcome based on whether or not true or false is returned. We can also get more complex with conditional statements and could have many conditions (if something is <= 1, else if < 5, else if < 10, else...).  
   +A daily life conditional: if I don't get out of bed in the morning I will accomplish nothing productive in a day, else if I do get out of bed in the morning I may have a productive day.  
   +When I go to my favorite website for clothing they try to get me to log in. If you click that you do not have an account then they pop up a window trying to get you to create an account and get a discount. This would be a conditional statement situation, where there are different outcomes (what a user would see displayed) depending on what you click.  



1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.  

   +When you have multiple conditions you would begin your first statement with if(parameters), the computer would read this statement and if it returned false (for the arguments passed in) then it would move to the next statement. The next statement would begin with else if. The computer reads this and once again would move along if false was returned. There could be more else if statements and then last would come an else statement. If none of the other statements returned true then this is where our interpreter would stop and the code inside the curly braces would be executed. At any given step, if true is returned then the script ceases to read any of the other statements and it would execute the code in the curly braces at this point.

1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?  

   +I'm not quite sure I understand what answer is being looked for here or if I understand all the tools that are available to me quite yet, as a future developer. I imagine that I could work out a flow chart and this would help to work through the problem logically. I could also open up a text editor, like this, and practice executing a particular function and then log it with console.log. I can then see (in my terminal) if conditions are met.


1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?  

   +I wonder how many parameters a function can have (all separated by commas of course). I also wonder how complicated most code blocks get inside of if statements and functions. This is something I'll have to go check out on a working website, using inspect. It's still all greek to me but I suppose I can simply look inside of the curly braces to see how much is included in the code block.  
   +Also, I'm finally understanding what is happening in JavaScript, with the calling of functions. I see that we're establishing our functions and then we're calling them many times, instead of writing the same statements over and over. I still have vague questions about this -- questions that I'm not quite sure how to put into words yet. I suppose I'm wondering about formatting in a JavaScript document. Will you see all the "go to" or the basic functions and statements at the top of a document and then continuous calls to them afterwards?
