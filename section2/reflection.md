## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?
* I definitely tend to ask questions too late. Like, 'I didn't see the butter in the fridge so I drove to the store for butter only to come home and see my kids making toast with the butter I didn't see,' level of late. This will likely be one of my biggest and hardest lessons to learn at Turing but I'm aware and committed to working on it!

2. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?
* I noticed this and I really enjoyed it! Loosening up those training wheels and it totally supports my learning in a positive way.

3. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.
* A conditional statement essentially tells the computer to either do one thing or another based on specified criteria. In real life, a good example is weather conditions affecting activities! If it is thunder storming, we may stay inside and play card games. If it is sunny and warm, we may go swimming! In a web application, like Rent The Runway, if I select that I am looking for a black tie event outfit, the app will likely only serve me fancy outfits. If I select that I am looking for daily wear, the app will serve me wearable pieces for several occasions.

4. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.
* You will code as many if/else possibilities as you need. The computer will read them line by line until it gets to a line of code that results in true. Once it hits true, it stops there and spits out the specified output. If it doesn't come across a true, it will use the else line of code or, if you don't have one, I'm assuming you'll get an error.

5. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?
* You can use your console inside of chrome!

6. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
* Truthfully, I cannot think of a question, at the moment. I am feeling a-ok with what content has been covered thus far!
