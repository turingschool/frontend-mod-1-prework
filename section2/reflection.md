## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

*I think I have yet to find the best balance when it comes to asking questions. I tend to hesitate to ask but then that means I wait too long or end up going down a google rabbit hole. I find it is intimidating to ask questions in Slack but I also think it is good practice for being uncomfortable and pressing forward.*

1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

*It was a mixed bag. I think that I may have learned better to be honest but also may have doubted myself more. It took me far longer to get through this section BUT I also think that I better understand this section, in particular the functions section. Until I started to practice them using outside resources (found the video provided in this section the most helpful), the textbook wasn't fully making sense to me. I think I learn better by seeing a modeling of it but then practicing on my own, while researching it further to flesh out additional information. It is definitely uncomfortable because coding is hard, but it is also so rewarding when what you are learning about suddenly clicks!*

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

*A conditional statement is a statement we run using if/else/then statements to see if the code can run properly because the condition has been met and can execute the statement or if not, what the code needs to be instead: if (condition is met) {execute}, if not, then another line of code runs to see if it meets the condition.*

*An example in real life would be deciding if you might walk or drive to a friend's house that is down the street depending on the weather. If weather is nice, then I will walk. If the weather is not nice, then I will drive.*

*An example of a web application is when I log onto the online library catalog for work to check a student account, if I input the correct student name then I can access their account information, but if I input their name incorrectly then I cannot access their account information.*

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

*-The first thing that needs to be done with an 'if' statement is to define the variable.

-Once that variable is defined then the multiple conditions (else if statements) can be applied to it to see which one will work out.

-Thus looking at the example  used in the if-statments.js file about the dog's age, we needed to determine the age to figure out what that dog would qualify as (puppy/adult/senior) in regards to the if...then statement searching for quality (asking versus telling to see whether the if conditions were met).

-Thus in the case we were determining what a 3 year old dog would be considered, so first we defined the variable which was the dogAge. Secondly we created the conditions, if...else.

-Because we wanted to find the strict equality, the conditional was set up that the dog's age would equal either a puppy, adult, or senior type of dog.

-The age had to strictly equal the type of dog so that the conditional could be met to declare the dogs age was equal to the type of dog it was.

-So it was set up as if dog's age is strictly equal to 3 then that dog is an adult, which was the age the dog was so the condition was met.

-The other two options were ages which had conditions that needed to be met to classify the dog as either a puppy or a senior. So if the dog was was 1 then the dog was considered a puppy because that condition had been met, but if the dog was 10 then that dog was considered a senior because that condition had been met.

-The code was instructed to program the if/else/then statement to searching for a match to the question.*

1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

*I keep checking my conditionals but printing out the first few lines of my code using the console  in my browser, because it allows me to see if the conditions are met or not and if I need to further write code to get to the answer. But additionally, I also checked by running  console.log through node within my terminal to see if my output was correct and if there were any errors in my code.*

1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?

*How can you the developer better determine how to write the statements when there are comparisons involved? I find writing code when it involves the math portion trickiest, so what is the best way tp practice these?*
