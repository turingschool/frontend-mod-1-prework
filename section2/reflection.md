## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

   I feel like I typically wait too long to ask questions, especially when I'm in a group, because I'm so afraid that it will make me look dumb. I've definitely done the thing where I spend hours chasing my tail in google when I could have asked in Slack or during a zoom session. I need to give my ego some rest and realize that if I'm asking it there's probably other people with the same question.

1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

   At first, it was intimidating trying to look up certain parts of the exercises because I'm still getting used to deciphering the way coding documentation is written. I've been using the `man` command in terminal to try and understand it better, and the language there is particularly dry. I think it has been helpful, because the more I read documentation, the easier time I will have understanding what I'm reading about.

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

   A conditional statement is a series of comparison operators that determines the final outcome of what the code block executes. A conditional in daily life is that if I shower, my girlfriend will kiss me but if I don't shower my girlfriend will call me trash can boy. In Gmail, `if` I click on an email, it will mark it as "read", `else` the email will remain marked as "unread".

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

   By using `else if` statements, multiple conditions can be chained together in a conditional statement. The program will read the conditions starting with the first `if`. If the `if` comparison is `true`, the statement(s) contained in `if` will run. If the `if` comparison is `false`, the program moves on to the next `else if` statement in the command, and follow the same protocol. The program will go down the line of `else if` statements until it either finds a `true` comparison and executes that statement, finds an `else` statement that doesn't require a comparison and just tells it to execute a statement, or nothing is `true` and nothing happens.

1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

   You can use logical operators to utilize multiple conditions in a single `if` statement. Using `&&` will check that both conditions are met, while `||` will check if either one or the other conditions is met.

1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?

   I read that there's a type of conditional called a switch, is that another way of saying if/else or is that another concept entirely?

   Can if/else statements be nested within each other? Condition inception?
