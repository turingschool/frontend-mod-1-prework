## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?
* I definitely wait WAY too long before asking questions. I'm guilty of spending hours googling and banging my head against my desk before asking for help. I even live with my brother-in-law who is an excellent programmer, who's spoken at ruby conferences, so I have no excuse not to just walk downstairs and ask him. I have the tendency to want to prove that I can do things on my own and not need help...yea clearly I have some pride issues to work on, BUT at least I can admit that. The suggestion of setting a 30 minute timer is something I think I will start doing.
* I really liked rubber ducky trick. I sorta do this already with my dog - I've explained all kinds of concepts to him just to make sure I understand them. It has certainly helped a lot and I'm sure I'll continue to do that.  


1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?
* The lack of detailed instructions didn't bother me at this point because I feel like I am still pretty confident with most of these commands, syntaxes, and data types. I think it's good practice to send us off on our own to learn/teach ourselves since that will be a more realistic expectation of our future when we are launched into our careers.

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.
* a conditional statement produces a result based on a number of true or false answers. They are used to perform different actions depending on different conditions. A daily life conditional could be "if I have no clean shirts then it's time to do laundry. If I have clean shirts then I don't need to do laundry." A web application conditional might be "If Instagram user follows more than 20 accounts - do not send suggested people to follow. If Instagram user follows less than 20 accounts then suggest other accounts to follow."

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.
* You can add multiple conditions to an `if` statement by using `else if`. If the value passed through the statement doesn't equal the first condition then it moves onto the next condition. If it doesn't meet the second condition then it moves onto the third condition. If it meets that condition then the function is complete and will print the output or preform the action of the function.

1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?
* Using the logical operator `&&` you can check if two conditions are met. If you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met then you use the `||` logical operator.  

1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
I have a little experience programming from a data analysis course I took last year. I struggled with functions and understanding the parameters/arguments, but for some reason this time it all clicked! I think that video also REALLY helped. I learn better watching examples rather than reading about them...
