## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?
I tend to let myself get overwhelmed before asking for help. It's something I've been aware of and look to change in my Turing career.
1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

It took longer but the CodeAcademy exercises were the key difference in letting me finally progress and it felt amazing when I figured everything out.

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

A conditional is a statement which logically depends on other data: "If I'm in Philadelphia, then I'm also in America since Philadelphia is in America."

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

We add multiple conditions through logical operators like "and" which means that both conditions are necessary for activation, or the "or" operator means that only one condition is sufficient.

If Will is human he must be a mammal AND a primate

If Will is American he must have been born in America OR he naturalized later.

1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?
if and else if statements, operators.

1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?

If anything my progress on this section was most slowed by the details of grammar in JS. I knew what I wanted to say it was a matter of getting used to semicolons and brackets.
