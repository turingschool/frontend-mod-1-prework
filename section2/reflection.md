## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

I am noticing I tend to spend more time on a problem, knowing that I have a million questions throughout the process, before I entertain the idea of asking a question. Mainly because I feel like I should be able to find the answer on my own. I sort of go down a rabbit hole before I realize how much time has passed. The blog posts where interesting to read, especially in regards to the feeling of being judged as "dumb" for the questions you may ask. I think that worry, unfortunately, always sits in the back of my mind when asking questions.

1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

It definitely felt challenging. I think my biggest concern was not being able to remember something important from the previous steps given to complete tasks correctly. I felt like I took extra time to complete the tasks to make sure I did all the steps. It made me realize why having a good solid foundation and understanding in the skills we've learned so far will help to avoid forgetting some of the steps needed and help improve my workflow.

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

A conditional statement is a statement created to determine what code should be run within a program based on a list of criteria. If the criteria is met, the code is run. For example, in real life a conditional statement could be compared to a work schedule. If it is between the hours of 9am to 5pm Monday through Friday Jane Doe will be at work. If the time falls outside of these work hours, Jane will be at home. On Saturday mornings; however, she goes to the grocery store.
In a web application a conditional statement is probably used while limiting search results. For example, Instagram and hashtags. When a word is entered in the search field maybe a conditional statement is used to weed out hashtags that do not match the search.

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

Adding multiple conditions to an `if` statement can be done by adding two conditional statements separated by a logical operator.

```
if (testScore >= 80 && homeworkIsDone = true) {
  console.log("You pass the class!");
}
```
The program will read the code (if testScore is greater than or equal to 80 AND homeworkIsDone is true), if both statements are true compared message is used.

1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

You can run node in your terminal to verify the code will result in an outcome. You can use the console to test code snippets as well.

1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?

- Is there anything an `if` statement cannot account for?
