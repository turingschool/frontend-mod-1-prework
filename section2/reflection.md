## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

These blogs posts were definitely beneficial for me to read as I embark on the Turing journey. I am one who is slow to ask for help in most situations. I have always been a strong believer in figuring things out on my own. I also definitely have a fear of looking like I don't know what I'm doing. However, in an academic setting, I feel strongly that it is particularly important to overcome any fears I have about "looking dumb" or "being bad at this". It's time to learn - and that entails asking a lot of questions!

2. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

This section definitely felt a bit more self-guided than Section 1. I did have to reference Section 1 to see how to run node without the instructions, but got it figured out pretty quickly. Now it feels great to know how to do it and not just copy and paste! Having to do it on my own created more depth in understanding. Learning functions with less guidance was a bit uncomfortable. I had to watch the video provided a few times and reference the book, blog post and video to complete the exercise. Overall, though, I thought it was a good balance of providing the materials, but not spoon feeding the answers. I feel like I understand basic functions now.

3. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

A conditional statement tells a computer to do either one thing, or another, depending on which criteria is met. The conditional statement must also provide this criteria. A daily life conditional may be something like "If my mug is out of coffee, fill the mug. If my mug has coffee, leave it as is." A web application conditional is "If username and password match, allow access to homepage. If not, direct to a page saying "access denied".

4. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

You can add multiple condition to an if statement by using "else if". When using "else if," a computer reads through your blocks of code in order. If the block of code evaluates as true, it is executed. If it evaluates as false, the computer moves on to the next block. This repeats until it reaches the final "else" block of code and executes it because none of the outlined conditions are true.

5. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

Logical operators are available if you wish to evaluate if 2 conditions are met. The first logical operator is &&, which evaluates if BOTH conditions are met. The other logical operator is ||, which evaluates if EITHER of the conditions are met. To use these *before* running a block of code, they must be set as an argument of a function.

6. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?

- What are some other ways to use logical operators?
- I am a little fuzzy on what it means that the variable is only meaningful inside the function. Why is it skipped? Why is it useful to have it skipped? Can you use variables defined outside of the function inside the function?
- How do you use scale functions when you have a massive data set? It seems like having to type in every argument would be tedious.
