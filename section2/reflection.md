## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

*I tend to be more apprehensive in asking questions especially in larger groups because I am afraid that it might be a "dumb" question. However, after reading the articles and doing the Mod0 sessions I realize that asking questions is VERY important and there is no dumb question!!*

2. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

*I think it was really good practice at searching in google. The instructors in Mod0 stress that we will be using Google a lot when we are devs and we won't know the answers to everything. I think it was a good challenge and it felt like a little scavenger hunt to me!*

3. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

*A conditional statement helps you write code to perform different things for different decisions. You use the statements, if, else, and else if. For example, if I am booking a place on airbnb, there is a boolean for pets (true or false). If I choose yes, I want pets, then the code will log "Here are the houses that allow pets" if it is false then it will log "Houses that do not allow pets". See my example below*

```JavaScript
if (pet=true){
  console.log("Here are the houses that allow pets")
} else{
  console.log("Houses that do not allow pets")
}
```

4. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

*To add multiple conditions to an if statement, you add 'else' or 'else if' and another set of curly brackets which makes more complex statements. When the computer reads the code, it will take the first condition and if its true then it will run the code. If it is not true it will go to the next statement. If that statement is true it will run that code, if not, it goes to the next one. It will only run the condition that is true.*

5. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

*You can you use the logical and comparison operators before running a code block!*

6. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?

*Can you do calculations in if statements?*
