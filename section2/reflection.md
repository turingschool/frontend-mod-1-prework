## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

I feel confident when the time comes for me to ask a question i'll able to formulate my question in a proper manner to get the results i'm seeking. I definitely wait to long before asking for help, it's something i'm working on solving.

1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

I felt in a more academic setting this way. It made me swap back and forth between my notes and other resources. But i felt i had a good hold on it by the end of the section

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

having the computer decide between yes or no or a different condition. 

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how the program reads them and determines what to do.

You add multiple conditions to an `if` statement with the `else if` and `else` keywords. When defined the function will run the variable through the function of `if` then proceed down if the condition is met to the next function `else if` and so on until it reaches a solution.

1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

Logoical operators && or ||

1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
