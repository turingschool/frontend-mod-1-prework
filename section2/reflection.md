## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

In my current job, I am generally good at asking questions. I work as a retail beer buyer for a wine and beer store, and if I can't find a particular item for a special order or I can't find the case price or case deal of an item I very quickly reach out and text one or more of the beer representatives. If I can potentially find the solution in 5 minutes I will first look into it myself but if it will take a good bit longer or if I don't know where to look I do not hesitate to ask. I know that is their job and I even better I know that it often makes the rep feel more involved and invested in our store. I have seen the positive outcome of taking up someones else's time.

Looking ahead to Turing, I am very driven to look into a solution and after 30min of no forward progress - ask that question! When I get my first dev job, I will keep in mind what one of the blog posts observed about how a company surely values your time because they are literally trading currency for it, and therefore, it would be in their best interest for me to not spend 4hrs googling something when a teammate might help me get unstuck in 5 minutes.

1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
