## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?
I've started to not be so quick to ask questions but take a step back and research before seeking somebody to ask.  

1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?
I liked having several different resources to reference.  I feel like they all reinforced the idea and concept.  I thought that some of the supports were gone but I felt prepared enough to tackle the questions.  I had to look back at the YouTube video for some clarification about syntax.

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.
A conditional statement specifies a decision to be made if a condition is met, or if it isn't met.
A daily life conditional is deciding where to eat.  If you want to eat out, you can find a restaurant.  If you don't want to eat out, then you can eat at home.

One example where a conditional is used is if the box to "Save Password" is ticked or not.  If it's ticked, then the web app will save the password and keep you logged in.  If it's not ticked, then it won't save the password.

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.
You use `else if.`  The program sees if the first `if` statement evaluates true or not.  If so, then it runs the block of code.  If not, then it goes to the next  `else if` statement.  The program sees if the `else if` statement evaluates true or not.  If so, then it runs the block of code.  If not, then it goes to the next  `else if` statement.  If there's an `else` statement at the end, and when the program reaches it without running the previous statements, then it runs the block of code after the `else` statement.

1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?
Logical operators

1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
