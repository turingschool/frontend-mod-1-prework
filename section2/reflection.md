## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

I typically ask questions too soon when starting a task and then as I work through it, I wait too long to ask for help. I need to find a middle ground of not asking immediately in the beginning and also knowing I can reach out if I get stuck further down the road. I will keep this in mind in school and hope to make positive changes by the time I hit the workforce. It will save me both time and energy!

2. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

I was excited to put my practice to test! I found the outside resources incredibly informative and helpful when trying specific problems. I think pushing yourself to find the answer will be key to succeeding in this industry. The sooner we start the better!

3. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

A conditional statement includes comparison operators to return a specific value. A daily life conditional could be if I wake up before 7 AM, I need 2 cups of coffee to wake up. If I wake up anytime after 7 AM, I only need 1 cup of coffee to jump start the day. For web application, this would be used in any sort of diagnostic that produces a result based on the choices selected. For example, if I went onto webMD and selected that I had an upset stomach, was sleepy, and a lack of appetite, my diagnosis would be different than if I selected I was sleepy, had an upset stomach, and have chronic heart ache.

4. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

To add multiple conditions to an `if` statement, you add either or both `else if` `else` statements that will check the condition to see how it will run. If the condition is met, there will be an assigned codeblock for that specific outcome to run. If the condition is not met, there will be an alternative codeblock(s) that
that will run. The `else if` statements are linked to a specific outcome and the `else` statements are a catch all for those that are not specified.

5. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

To check that 1 of the 2 conditions are met, you can add || between the 2 conditions to represent an and/or condition. To check that two or more conditions are met, you would add && between the conditions to represent that it must satisfy any condition with this sign between it to read true.

6. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
Is it possible to log all scenario outcomes simultaneously?  Or would you just have to copy the code and change the values of each condition?
