## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?
- Unless I'm truly stuck and have exhausted multiple resources and have made no progress in 20-30 minutes I avoid asking questions because I know I can figure it out. I definitely lean on the side of too long which is something I'm working on. I always feel like I'm on the brink of figuring something out. Sometimes for whatever reason things don't click and at that point its better to reach out and ask for help then waste more time. So far I've only been stuck once where it was bad enough I felt I was wasting time and even if the solution was simple I reached out to my friends Valentino who is a Turing alumni, and my friend Ashish who is in my same Cohort. Another thing is respecting other peoples time. I don't want to waste someones time asking for help because I'm being lazy, unfocused and not being resourceful. Like I said earlier, even if you try your best sometimes things don't click and the best thing you can do to respect the time of whoever you're asking for help is to at least be sure you can explain what you are trying to do, what the problem is, what you have tried, and provide pictures if needed. Want to make it as easy for someone to help as possible.

1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?
- It felt humbling and daunting. It's not fun feeling incompetent but the more practice I get the more resourceful I get. I also realize over time that this constant struggle is normal, it's a process and I have to trust the process. Thinking like a true programmer requires taking the training wheels off, and learning things without constant hand holding. The deeper I get into the curriculum with less support, I become more accustomed to navigating through confusion and solving unfamiliar problems and I think that's one of the keys to becoming a successful programmer.

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.
- A conditional statement controls behavior of code. A real life example is a traffic light. If light is green then you go, if it's yellow you slow, if red you stop. A easy example on a web application is verifying your age when registering to certain sites. A lot of sites require you are equal to or greater than a certain age to register. For example, Twitter and Instagram requires users to be 13 or older.

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.
- You can add multiple conditions to an 'if' statement by adding as many 'else if' statements as needed and ending with an 'else' statement. The program will start with the first 'if' statement and check the condition. If the condition is met the program will execute the function. If the condition is not met it will move to the next 'else if' statement and check if that condition is met. If none of the conditions are met, the function following the last 'else' statement will be executed.

1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?
- Logical operators can satisfy this need. If you want to check that two conditions are met you can use '&&' which translates to 'and'. If you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met you can use '||' which translates to 'or'

1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
- While working on the section2 exercises I was wondering if you could put if else statements or functions inside of each other.
