## Section 2 Reflection

# Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

*I definitely tend to wait too long. I like to be thorough in exploring what aspects of a problem I do or don't understand, which helps to formulate the right question, but I often drag that process out longer than is helpful.*

# In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

*I'm starting to feel more confident in performing basic tasks in git. Going through those repeatedly without referencing instructions feels like it's helping develop the muscle memory for these tasks. I definitely want to speed up my workflow ASAP so that feels like a promising start.*

# What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

*An action to be taken if a particular condition is met. Ex. If the trashcan is full or if today is Friday, take the can liner out to the bin on the street and replace the liner in the can inside. I would imagine search filters rely on conditionals for their basic functions.*

# How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

*You can use `if (condition1) {...} else if (condition2) {...} else {...}` statements to test different conditions in succession and run different code depending on which condition, if any, is met. The first condition to be fulfilled will trigger its code to be run and the program will not evaluate any statements that come after.*

# What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

*When `&&` is used, the program will return the first condition to evaluate as false, or otherwise returns true if both conditions evaluate as true. This ensures that both conditions must be truthy for the ensuing code to run.*

*When `||` is used, the program will return the first condition to evaluate as true, or otherwise returns false if both conditions evaluate as false. This ensures that one or the other condition must be truthy for the ensuing code to run.*

# What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?

*Mostly just anxious to start using them in context. Then I'll feel like I'm grasping the practical use value and honing my skills in more complicated situations.*
