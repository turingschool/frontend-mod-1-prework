## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

    - I struggle asking questions online, mostly because I have a hard time knowing how to phrase them, and I feel like it is easier to tease out the question through conversations. I also struggle with Slack having to post to everyone. However, I have made it my goal to get over my fear of posting and to ask questions (no matter if I know exactly how to phrase them).
    - I would say I am somewhere in between too soon and too long. I tend to think of asking them too soon but once I start thinking of how to phrase it, I also think of other ways to address my question or search for the answer.

1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

    - It was helpful to force myself to remember how to run the file, without having to go back to the instructions and made it so that I will remember how to do it in the future.
    - Similarly, with the functions section, I made sure **I** was getting the information and definitions I needed from the resources, knowing that I wouldn't have an explanation in the Section 2 file.

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

    - A conditional statement is a structure that allows us to provide instructions to the program on when to run what code, based on criteria/conditions we provide.
    - An example of a daily life conditional is when we choose what to wear depending on the weather: if it is cold out, we put on a sweater, if it is hot, we put on shorts, etc.
    - I am assuming web applications use conditional statements when a username and password are entered. If the username/password match, then user can log in. If they don't match, then prompts them to _try again or reset username/password_.

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

    - To add multiple conditions, we use else if and/or else statements. The program reads each condition in order. For example, a statement that has three conditions:  after evaluating the first if statement, if the condition is met, then the program runs the code block directly after that condition. If the first condition is not met, then the program moves on to evaluate the next condition after the else if statement. If the condition is met, then the program runs the code block directly after that condition. If the second condition is not met, then the program moves on to run the code block after else statement. At that point, the program has used a process of evaluation, if the first and second conditions were not met, then they will run the last code block.

1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

    - conditional statements: if statements, if/else if statements, logical operators (AND and OR)

1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?

    - I am still having a hard time coming up with a definition for a falsy or a truthy. How would you define them in plain English?
    - Are functions often used inside of conditional statements?
