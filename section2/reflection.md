## Section 2 Reflection

**1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?**
 
 -Learning from the blog posts I have realized I do not utilize outside resources very adequately. I usually will sit for long times on questions before reaching for outside resources due to my stubbornness. I tend to feel like an idiot or a weak minded person when I continuously ask questions, even though the questions I ask usually either guide in the right direction or just resolve the issues I was having before hand.

**2. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?**

 -I really enjoyed learning from the outside resources. I was able to take down very good notes and was also able to use those notes to complete the assignments given to me. I am usually a hands on learner but the pace of read then do, read then do is becoming a very good way to absorb knowledge. I also found making my own notes from an outside source was much better than just having the answeres given to me on a slide and such. The reason behind this is because I had to make my own notes and my own words to fully understand the subject.

**3. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.**

 -A conditional statement is a block of code that is placed after a keyword of if or else. A conditional example in real life is like taking a shower. Your true statement would be along the lines of "If I take a shower then I will smell good." the else would then be "If I don't take a shower then I will smell bad." The usaged of a conditional on most web applications happen as soon as you sign up for an account that has a newsletter option assigned to it. Thats when `else ifs`, would also begin to appear. Becuase your `if` starts when you sign up for the account with the newsletter added. The `else` would be if you don't sign up for the newsletter as well.

**4. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.**

 -`else if` would be the way you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement. The program reads it like a diagram, or a build your own story situation. When you fit one condition then your log will choose that option. If you choose a different different then it will choose that condition. If you choose none and default to false the first condition then the `else` to your `if` statement will appear.

**5. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?**

  -Using the `let` command you can run your code before running each individual condition, if you feel uncomfortable doing that on your own system. You can also use Repl.it so that you may check your conditon code blocks.

**6. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?**

 -How much do `if` functions get used through out all websites. Is it a function that used very commonly or one that is mostly used at junior levels of web applications?
