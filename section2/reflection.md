## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

*  I think I'm in between. I can take a long time to ask questions the majority of the time when I'm learning something new because I have constantly asking questions and then I Feel like i get too comfortable asking questions, which then takes me to the mindset of "I need to tone down my asking of questions" cause I feel like an annoyance. These readings really helped put into perspective how and when to ask for assistance. I've been losing a lot of time in trying to figure things out on my own to not feel dumb and to not be a nuisance.

1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

* Honestly it felt scary and overwhelming. like the readings mentioned google is a good source for questions but if you don't know what to google or how to interpret the responses provided you can feel even more lost, confused, or dumb because you should be able to understand the examples they provide and you don't. Or you try and follow the examples provided and it doesn't help with the code that you're typing. I find youtube to be a bit more helpful as I'm a visual learner, and it helps that they're explaining code while also practicing it.

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.
*  conditional statements are a rules in the code which give options or choices on which code will run with if statements. If first condition/rule is met= true then the the action is performed and it will the code that meets the condition.
*  a daily conditional statement could be getting rewarded after passing a test.
  example being if the condition of getting an 80% or higher on the test you get a reward fro parents, but if you get 79 or you get a pat in the back. and anything under 70 you get grounded. If you pass a test with an 81% the first condition is met and you'll get rewarded by parents.
* I think a conditional statement could be used on an online store when theyre offering a type of deal depending on the certain amount being spent. so conditions can be:
if you spend $50 you'll receive $10 off entire purchase
if you spend $100 you'll receive $25 off entire purchase
if you spend $150 or higher you receive 20% off entire purchase and free delivery.


1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how the program reads them and determines what to do.
  ```JavaScript
if (){            //if this first condition is true it will execute the code
  console.log();
}else if (){      // if first condition isn't true & this one is, code will run
  console.log();
}else () {        // if none of the conditions are met this one will run
  console.log();
}
  ```
1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?
 Would my tools be repl and node on the terminal?? I'm sorry I didn't understand. cause I have used repl and node to check my code.

1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
* I feel like i really understood if statements and functions. But my questions is, is there a limit to how many conditional statements a developer can add?
