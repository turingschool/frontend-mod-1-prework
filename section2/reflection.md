## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

    I feel good about asking questions. I have had to train myself to try and figure out the answer on my own first before asking it to other people. In my last job, I found it to be extremely useful to save my questions up until the end of the day or weekly meetings to ask my supervisor. This gave me the time to make sure I (1) knew what I was asking and (2) the time to think and make sure I explored all the recourses first. Also, this standard helped us keep a work flow and not be interrupted constantly by someone else's question.

2. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

    I liked it! In section 1 I could not figure out how to run node from the terminal, but with section 2 I had made the mental connection on how to do it. Instructions are good to get me started, but sometimes I can find myself going on autopilot and not using problem solving to actually solve the problem. I would say this section took me a bit longer to finish, but I am feeling confident in the work.

3. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

    A conditional statement is a statement that tells a computer to do one thing or another. An example of a conditional statement in real life is deciding if you want to date someone. If the condition of them hot is true then you date them, if its no but the condition of are they rich is true; you date them. If else then you do not.

    An example of a conditional statement used in a web application is when you visit a liquor stores website and it asks you to verify your age. If you are >= 21 (true) then it runs the code that let's you into the website. If you are < 21 it will not let you enter the website.

4. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

    When you want to add multiple conditions to an `if` statement you use the logical operators which are && or ||. && makes sure both conditions are true to evaluate to be true. || says one OR the other must be true to evaluate as true. The computer runs from left to right so if the first condition is false in a && statement, it no longer needs to read the second condition. And if the first condition returns true in a || statement then it no longer needs to run because it has found at least one value to be true.

5. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

    I'm not sure if I fully understand this question, but the number one tool I can use to check if conditions are met before running a block of code is running the scenario out in my head. I am not sue if running node is considered running a block code or not. If it is not consider that then thats a tool I can use.

6. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?

    I want to spend some more time working on naming functions and deciding what names are the best and descriptive, but also concise. I think with more time and using more functions it will make more sense, but for right now I feel like my function names aren't right.
