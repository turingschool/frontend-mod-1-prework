## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

Reading these blog posts by developers was very encouraging as I seek to ask better questions during my time at Turing. At this point, I feel confident about asking questions but I seek to get better at timing of when to ask them and to ask them more effectively. I think I tend to wait too long, as I error on the side of thinking it is a dumb question or want to make sure I have taken the time to try and figure it out.

2. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

I felt like this supported my learning in making sure I was confident in understanding some of these processes and where to go find them if I couldn't remember a certain direction. This helped me make sure I was focusing on being detail oriented, thinking through every step of the process, and remember why I needed to do a specific step. Afterwards I felt more confident in my abilities to do something like run a file in node without having to look at the instructions every time.

3. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

Conditional statements have impact on the behavior in JavaScript and determine whether or not pieces of code can run. They say what to do in a given situation. An example in daily life might be if I do my job well I will get a promotion, or else if I do it mediocre I will not get a promotion until next year, or else if I don't do it at all I will get fired. A conditional is probably used in a website I use for work where students can apply for jobs. If I student applies for a job with a resume attached, the page will say "thank you for uploading your documents, please proceed". If a resume is not attached, the page will say "no documents were uploaded, are you sure you want to proceed?" (multiple conditions).

4. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

To add multiple conditions to an 'if' statement I can use the if...else statement or if/else if/else. A program reads these by checking to see if the 'if' statement evaluates to true. If so, the first block of code is executed. If it evaluates to false, the next condition is checked to see if it evaluates to true. if so, this next block of code is executed. If false, the following condition is checked. This continues until the final else statement is checked.

5. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

If I want to check that TWO conditions are met, I can use the logical AND operation (&&). This only returns true if both operands are true. If I want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, I can use the logical OR operation (||). This only returns false when both operands are false.

6. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
If statements seem very useful and important. I feel comfortable understanding the basic logic behind these but seek to get more practice with the syntax, especially with various data types. I would also wonder, could it be switched that a block of code will run if something is evaluated to false, as opposed to true?
