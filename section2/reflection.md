## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

* I think I feel good about asking questions. I have a tendency to wait too long to ask a question, because I want to make sure I know how to ask the question, and also make sure it isn't about to be covered as we move forward. I am working on writing all my questions down and finding a balance of when to ask and when to wait and figure it out on my own.


1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

* I had to go back and reference running a file in node, but felt that it stuck in my brain more this time. I liked being challenged to remember on my own first. I enjoyed having multiple sources to explain certain key concepts and liked looking at different instructional examples to better cement the concepts. I felt good about having all of the different types of sources and it helped me learn. This is helping to expose me to all the different resources available and styles of teaching. I think challenging me to recall information or get it on my own is good practice.

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

* A conditional statement is based on using if/else if/else statements. It works through statements to check if a condition resolves to true/false. In password protected profiles, a conditional statement is probably used to determine if my password meets certain criteria needed such as the right number of characters, numbers, special characters..etc.


1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

* You use "else if" or a logical operator to add more than one condition in a conditional statement. A program reads top to bottom, left to right and evaluates if a condition is true or false. It will work left to right and down the code until a condition is evaluated as true. When a condition is evaluated as true, it will then perform a function or print a statement, basically whatever we instructed the program to do under that condition and it will stop running the code for that "if" statement. The program will continue to run until a condition is met.

1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

* I can use logical operators to check multiple conditions. This includes || (OR), && (AND), and !(NOT).


1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?

* In our vocabulary, we have to define condition and conditional. I am clear on what a condition is, but not sure what a conditional is? Does it refer to conditional statement?
