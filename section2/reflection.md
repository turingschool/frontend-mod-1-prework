## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?
  * I certainly resonate with the 2nd reason people avoid asking questions outlined in the first article. My typical inclination when faced with an unfamiliar and difficult topic is to dig deep and push on solo (well, solo with Google by my side). However, as the article mentions, this can lead to unnecessary self-critical observations and wasted time (regardless whether my search is fruitful). I plan to follow the "20 minutes" rule described by this article to prevent myself from going down the Google rabbit-hole.

2. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?
 * Honestly, I welcome the chance to figure things out on my own (as alluded to in the previous question) - the reward can sometimes feel greater when knowledge is self-sought. I feel that there is a balance between being guided and going solo when it comes to learning or understanding a new topic. However, had I gotten stuck or felt as though I was lost during this section, I could certainly see myself becoming stressed or uncomfortable. I'm happy that I have a great source of assistance in both my instructors and fellow cohort members at Turing.

3. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.
  * Conditional statements (if/if else statements) are used to perform specific actions based upon the outcome of conditional expressions.
	* Daily Life Conditional: If I do not complete the pre-work assignments, I will not pass Turing.
	* Web Application Conditional: If "Opt Out" is selected, a user should not receive promotional emails from REI.

4. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.
* If two or more conditions (that produce different results) need to be evaluated, then `else if` or `else` statements can be used (after the `if` statement). The first condition is evaluated within the `if` statement, and if this equates to `true`, the `if` block will run. However, if the `if` statement equates to `false`, then the interpreter will move on to the `else if` statements. An `else` block will run if none of the conditions specified equate to `true`.

5. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?
* There are two logical operators that can be used (in logical expressions) to verify whether two conditions are met or if 1 of 2 are met - AND (&&) and OR (||) respectively. Using AND, both conditions will need to evaluate to `true` for the expression to be `true`, otherwise it's `false`. Using OR, only one condition needs to be `true` for the expression to evaluate to `true`.

6. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
* This might be getting into something we will be discussing in the future, but is there a "Function" class? And when I declare a function, am I instantiating a Function object?
