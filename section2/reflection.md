## Section 2 Reflection


### Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?


*I feel pretty comfortable asking questions, but don't like it when sometimes people hear me ask a lot of questions and then assume I don't know other things and over-explain. I think generally I am pretty good at trying it out on my own first and then asking, but I have moments where I wait too long trying to figure it out on my own.*


### In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?


*I was pretty excited to pull from different resources and get a bit more familiar with a small handful of places online where I can find tutorials. I subscribed to the youtube channel that was linked for the section on functions in case I need help with something else because the person who explained them seems like he may be helpful to me on other topics too. It was a little intimidating looking at some of the articles that sometimes had a lot of content and I wasn't always quite sure how much of the information would be helpful to me. It was good practice though to read through and then go back to once I was doing the exercises and trying to put the information from the articles into context.*


### What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.


*A conditional statement is a statement that will be evaluated to be true or false. One example might be when you log into a website and they have the checkbox that says, "I am not a robot." I would think that if the condition is evaluated as "true," then the user is able to log in and interact with their website account and if it is evaluated as false, then the user remains on the page and is informed that they need to check the box to proceed.*


### How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.


*To add multiple conditions to an 'if' statement, you can use 'else if' and/or 'else'. The computer will read the 'if' statement. If it is evaluated to be true, the computer will run the code provided within the curly brackets. If false, it will move on to the next line of code, which could be 'else if' or 'else.' Else if' will be evaluated and if it is true, will run the code provided within its curly braces, and if not, will move on to the next line. This could be 'else if' or 'else'. If it is 'else if,' it will continue evaluating for true or false until something is true. 'Else' is the last condition and gives directions for what to run if every if and else if statement prior to it was evaluated to be false.*


### What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?


*The logical operators, && (AND) and || (OR) are available if you want to check that two conditions are met. The logical operator && (and) prompts the computer to evaluate each part of the if statement. If each condition of the statement is true, then the statement is evaluated to be true. If any or all conditions of the statement are false, then the statement is evaluated to be false. While using the logical operator || (OR), the statement will be evaluated as true if any of the conditions are met and will run as false if all of the conditions are not met.*


### What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?


*Why is it that when declaring functions and calling them, the rules for order are different than with the rest of the code? Are there better ways to do it for different situations?*
