## Section 2 Reflection

1. **Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?**

The blog posts made me feel more comfortable with asking questions, especially with the worry that the questions will be
perceived as dumb. However I still tend to wait too long to ask them. Part of the reason is that I don't want to
burden other people by asking them to take the time to help me. Especially if the answer is something that can be found
with some research, I don't want to be perceived as asking someone else so I don't have to put in the effort to research it myself.

I like having the 20 or 30 minute rule. I can sit and try to get to the bottom of something for a long time, so it is nice to have a firm limit where I can know that I tried but it is ok to ask for help.

1. **In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?**

I feel like I retain what I've learned better when I have to do a little more discovery on my own. I felt comfortable with the
amount of direction given in these exercises, although I did have to reference past instructions a couple of times. I think
if all of the resources were given to me every time they wouldn't really become ingrained in my mind. It was helpful to look at
multiple different resources for the functions as well, because hearing it explained in a few different formats helped the idea sink in and also I think appeals to all learning styles.

1. **What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.**

A conditional statement determines what action is executed based off of the conditions or inputs.
- **Daily life conditional**: When I get home from work, if there is mail in the mailbox I walk over and take it out. Otherwise, I walk past the mailbox straight to my door.
- **Web app**: Spotify- If I click the pause button when I am listening to music, it stops playing. Else, the music continues
playing.

1. **How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.**

You can use an `else/if` statement. The computer will read the conditions sequentially, and stop once it reaches a condition that is met. If the first `if` statement is not met, the computer will move on to the next `else if` statement and see if that condition is true. This continues until the computer reaches a condition that is met, at which point it executes the code block that follows. If none of the conditions are met, the computer will execute the `else` statement.

1. **What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?**

You can use the logical operators && (and) and || (or). If you are using && with two conditions, the output will only be true if
both conditions have been met. When using ||, true will be returned if any of the conditions is met. False will only be returned if both of the conditions are not met.

1. **What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?**

- When writing if/else statements, why do we format the curly brackets like
```javaScript
{
console.log();
}
```
instead of doing it all on the same line?
- What would happen if you wrote an `else/if` function that didn't have an else statement at the end, and none of
the other statements were true? Would it break your code?
