## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

  - Historically, I generally wait too long to ask questions. I love the      process of trying to figure things out on my own, with the ideal that in my efforts I might learn more than what I set out to discover. About a year ago, I began to shift my tendencies to ask a questions "somewhere in between" for a key reason mentioned in the blog posts: TIME! I found myself with more tasks on my plate than I could handle as I was promoted in my job and just didn't have the time to figure things out like I used to, so I'd either delegate or ask pretty quickly. I think that I still need to work on this, as I'm continually being reminded of how precious time is, especially when someone else is paying your salary as mentioned in the article...or your task getting done is holding someone else up.

1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?
  - I was very comfortable with exploring on my own. I find that sometimes an article is best for me, sometimes  a video is best. I like the option to seek out a resource on the subject matter that really resonates best with me at that particular moment and for a particular subject. Additionally, it's nice to be able to find a source that give you a clear understanding and the corroborate it with another supporting source that might go into a little more detail or describe it slightly more nuanced than the first.

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

  - An example of a conditional would be if someone is of drinking age. Often when you visit alcohol companies sites, say you need a recipe for a Moscow Mule and visit the grey goose website, you are asked to enter your birthdate. The website then does a quick calculation (current year - birth year) and determines if you are 21 or not to allow entry to the website. The conditional here is as follows:
    if age >= 21 ,allow entry to website.
    else, do not allow entry to website.


1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.
  - You start with writing the first conditional expression to be checked with just "if" in front of it, followed by the code block to be executed if it is true. Then after typing "else if" and then adding the next conditional expression to be checked, you add the code block to be executed if this is true. You would continue to add the same "else if" in front of conditions to be checked, until you have eliminated all of the explicit conditions you want to explore and there is only one remaining conditional outcome that will share the same logged result or outcome. At this point you would only include "else" before the final conditional and code block to be ran.

1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?
  - Logical operators are the tools that you would employ to check if one or two conditions are met before running a block of code. The logical operators include AND (&&) and OR (||).

1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
  - Currently none come to mind.
