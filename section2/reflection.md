## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

I don't personally mind asking questions. I have done it a few times during class. I think I personally am somewhere between though. I tend to forget my question if I wait too long so I try to ask within a reasonable timeline.

1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

I personally enjoyed being a little freer than the last section. It gave me a lot of time to tinker around with some of the functions and problems. I learn the best by trial and error and being very hands on so this was actually pretty beneficial to me. It was uncomfortable sometimes searching something up and it's not giving me the answer I'm looking for.

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

A conditional statement is a statement that uses "if", "else", and/or "else if" to define if a condition is true or false.

## Daily life
  - If I brush my teeth then my teeth will be clean or else they will be dirty.

## Web Apps
  - If I click on this settings button on Facebook then a list of different option paths will appear.  

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

You add multiple conditions by using `else if` and `else` in your statements. The program reads it by going down the listed statements until one fo the conditions passes.

1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

You use conditional statements that check to make sure either one or more conditions are passed.

1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?

A question I have is, can you create a function that uses conditional statements too. We didn't do any in the practice activities but I assume that you probably can.
