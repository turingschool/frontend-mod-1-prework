## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?
   - I think I tend towards both issues. If I had my druthers I would ask a constant string of questions - but I have learned over the years that this is both distracting and sometimes socially irritating. As for deciding when to ask for help - I think I will struggle for a very long time before I decide to ask - that satisfaction feels too good. However, I am going to try and start timing myself - see how long I actually spend going in circles.

1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?
   - I did not find it uncomfortable! I think training wheels are being removed at
   a good pace and I feel like I have the tools to find the answers that I need.
   Having to remember, for example, the correct way to run a file in node forced me to now
   REMEMBER how to do it for next time. I had relied on copy and pasting (even though I know I wasn't supposed to).

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.
   - A conditional statement is an instruction to do or evaluate one thing based
   on a set of criteria. In daily life a conditional statement could me
   If I am tired, then I will drink coffee. On a website, a conditional statement might be found on Air Bnb, where IF the house is available on the selected date, then display the information.

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.
   - You can add multiple conditions to an `if` statement by adding "else" clauses. These create further possibilities in your code depending on the variables and criteria. A program will read each conditional block by block, once a condition is met and executed, it will continue on to the next section of code.

1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?
   - && - represents AND. While || represents OR.

1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
   - In the if-statements exercise, why was == operator used, rather than ===?
   - We talk often about syntax and readability - I don't understand why the curly brackets are spaced they way they are. It just seems to look confusing to me - are they separated because for reasons of function that I don't understand. I shan't be satisfied with just "that's convention" because it seems so counterintuitive, there must be a good reason!
