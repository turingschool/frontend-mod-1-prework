## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

I sometimes struggle to ask questions, a lot of times it seems like asking questions means that you werent paying attention or that you aren't smart enough to understand something on the first try. I know that these things are not true, which is why I have been trying to push myself to ask questions more often even if its something that I understand most of.

1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

I like that those instrustions were removed, it forced me to go into terminal and play around to figure out how to run the files on my own. I was also a little uncomfortable using the outside resources at first but I understand how important doing research and sifting through information is, so i thought it was good practice.

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

A conditional statement is a statement that will evaluate a condition, and based on the result of that evaluation it will determine what the next thing to do is. For example, a real life conditional could be something like "If i am hungry then I will eat, otherwise I will not." conditionals could be used to log into a website, "if username and password are correct, log in, otherwise return an error saying "incorrect username and password combination?"

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

if you want an if statement to look at multiple conditions you can separate the conditions by  "||" which means "or" or "&&" which means and. depending which you choose the program looks at the conditional statements inside the parentheses and evaluates the first part, lets say 2 > 3 it evaluates this to false because it is not true. it will move on to the next part of the conditional lets say 3 > 2, this evaluates to true. If the two conditions were separated by || then the whole statement would be true because at least one part was true, it will then perform the commands inside the braces. if they were separated by && then the whole conditional would evaluate to false because at least one part wase false and it will not run the code in the braces.

1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

I think I might have just explained this but the || operator will make sure that 1 of two conditions are met where as the && will check to see if all of the conditions are met.

1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?

I am unsure about the difference between methods and functions. They seem like they do basically the same thing but with different syntax, is that true?
