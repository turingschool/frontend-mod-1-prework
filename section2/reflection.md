## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

-I have lived many years not asking the "dumb question" because I did not want to appear incompetent. I always felt I had something to prove and also always felt that I lacked what I needed and wanted to gain that on my own. That feeling of being an imposter wasted an incredible amount of my time. As a result, I have gotten better at asking the dumb questions and feeling more confident in my skin, but I am well-aware that my default setting is to seek the answer myself and "prove" to others I am "capable". The final blog post really spoke to the value of time. It resonated with me that it is dumber to spend hours seeking the answer to a dumb question rather than simply asking it and moving on quickly when a superior or colleague knows the answer.

1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
