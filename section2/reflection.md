## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

I feel like questions are import and and even necessary, but it can be hared to judge when to ask them. My tendency with questions is to wait too long to ask. That being said, I haven't felt like I've been doing that as much in this program so far.

1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

Honestly, I felt pretty fine doing it. I had messed up running the node in the last section to know pretty darn well how to get it to work properly in this one. Using different resources to learn, also felt pretty normal. It's honestly nice to know that there isn't just the one way to learn how to do something, and that I can search it up on my own as needed.

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

A statement that determines if a block of code is run.
 * If I wake up when my alarm goes off, then I didn't oversleep
Email account.
 * If the username and password match what is in the system, then give access to the account


1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

For a single condition, an `if` statement works well. For 2 conditions you can use an `if` statement and an `else` statement. For 3 or more conditions you can add an `else if` for each condition more than 2.
The program will determine if the `if` statement's condition is met. If it is the program will run the associated block of code, if not it will skip over that block of code. If there is an `else if` statement the program will determine if the conditions are met for that statement. If they are it will run the associated block of code, if not it will skip that code block. If there is an `else` statement and none of the other statements conditions were met, the program will run that block of code.

1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

* You can use the `&&` operator to specify you want 2 conditions to be met to run a code block.
* you can use the `||` operator to specify you want at least 1 of 2 conditions to be met to run a code block.

1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
