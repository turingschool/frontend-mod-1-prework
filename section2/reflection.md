## Section 2 Reflection

1. ### Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

I feel confident in asking dumb questions, specifically at Turing. I am brand new to coding! Of course I’m going to ask “dumb” questions! However, I tend to have a “do it yourself” mentality and go down Google holes only to come out more confused before and use slack almost as a last resort. I found it helpful to vent to a water bottle or roommate, google based off of what I said and then reach out to Slack. The DIY mentality has definitely played a bit of a negative role since I end up spending almost *too* much time on a problem. However, I note my confusion and look over notes again and do a little bit more research when I’m not familiar with the concept and feel a lot more confident.

2. ### In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

At first I was frustrated that there wasn't a node in each exercise. Then I actually looked into what a node is and realized that I can type it into my terminal easily. I enjoy looking into other resources and have found myself looking to outside resources throughout section1 as well simply to be able to understand things better. It mixes up learning styles as well.

3. ### What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

A conditional statement determines which path to take depending on the user's interaction with the webpage. It is based on if/else/elseif concepts that decide which path to take depending on a script.
In real life, I live with five other people. If someone is taking a shower in the morning, I go outside and do yoga. If there are people having coffee outside, I make breakfast.
Conditionals are used in personality quizzes all the time! Buzzfeed quizzes come to mind where you answer multiple choice questions based on likes/dislikes and personality traits. If you choose mostly 'A,' you receive one result and so on for 'b', 'c', and 'd'. If you choose a mix of the four, the webpage will likely be prompted to ask an additional question in order to determine a result that best fits the script.

4. ### How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

You would add multiple conditions to an 'if' statement inserting elseif/ else to differentiate paths. For example,
let's say a user doesn't choose the first option but the fourth option such as the door choice/ bear scenario from
the Decision Making exercise. The script would run through the first, second and third outputs before landing on the fourth
and giving an output that was determined by the user's input.


5. ### What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

The *logical/ selector* operators.
+ To check that two conditions are met, I would use the __&& (and) operator__.
+ To make sure one of the two conditions are met, I would use the __|| (or) operator__.


6. ### What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
+ Do you need to end the script with "else"?
