## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?
  i tend to sometimes ask questions a little late. i try to get the answer on my own but if i cant i ask for help and at times the person i ask will say you should of asked me awhile ago. i dont mind asking question but i try to figure it put myself to see if i can get it

1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?
  i liked trying to find the answer on my own. it made get in the habit to google my questions in a better way. it made me think of the wording i i should use when googling.

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.
  is a statement where depending what condition is met the computer will do a curtain task. like to log in to something if email and password is correct it will let you through. if it is not correct then it will say try again.

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.
  to add multiple conditions you either put && or || between the conditions so the computer knows that its to be either both conditons have to be met or one or the other has to be met

1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?
  i like to use the website repl.it so i can run the code and see if runs smoothly. if it doesnt then its okay because its a console on a website

1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
is it possible to combine a function in a function?
