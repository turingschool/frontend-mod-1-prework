## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

  I think my problem is waiting too long to ask questions. Although I consider myself to be great at Googling to find answers I find, that often, I rely on that a bit too much. 90% of the time I can find what I am looking for in regards to computers, software, coding, and even life questions on Google. Beyond that 90%, the 10% often gets lost in my brain, and that something I need to take initiative and step up and ask questions. Before Turing, most of my issue with that was I didn't have someone to ask questions. Now that I have a community of *nerds* learning the same thing I am, I feel more comfortable asking those questions, hopefully.

1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

  I am beyond comfortable with the idea of Googling answers for support as I said above. What I find to be the most helpful is an example breaking down what I am learning. For things like functions as learned in section 2, having the *example* then  the *you do*  section of the exercises provided enough learning material for me to understand what I was doing, and also why it was working. I think this method of teaching allows for students to learn at their own pace and also learn how to learn if that makes sense.

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

  Conditional statements allow the code to execute if the right conditions are met. Otherwise, it will not. A good example I think of is traffic lights. In America, like other places too, we have red, yellow, and green lights. Each of these lights being lit tell the driver what to do. If there is a red light drivers on the road are meant to stop and wait. If the light is green, the driver can proceed through the intersection. And lastly if the light is yellow, drivers are meant to slow down *(or speed up)* depending on the time the yellow has been lit for.

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

  Beyond the if statements, in JavaScript we can use the if else statement in the same function. From top to bottom the code will check through each of the conditions, and when one of the conditions is met, it will execute the code beyond the if else statement.

1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

    In JavaScript we can use logical operators to check if two conditions are met. Using the operator **&&** paired with two conditions on either side, will check that both conditions are met before execution of the code.

1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?

  I am confused on the integration of multiple if statements embedded inside of each other. Though I assume we will dive deeper into learning about this in the future, I came across certain situations where having an if statement inside of another if statement was doable, it would make the coding a good bit more understandable.
