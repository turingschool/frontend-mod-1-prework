## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

I found that post to be very helpful. I struggle with trying to find the answer for too long on occassion and then other times, I try to be proactive, but seem to ask too soon. There is a question sweetspot, I think. They addressed that a bit in the post with the point of Timing.

2. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

That was helpful to make sure that I had learned from the first section and that I was paying attention. Going out to use other resources for functions was fun as well because I feel like the different media types helped me to solidify everything. I could read up in one section but then had the video to see everything in action, so to speak. I enjoyed this slight "test".

3. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

Conditional statements are used like a flowchart and decide the flow based on the success of the outlined conditions. For example - if this fact is true, then this will result.

In daily life, a conditional statement would be, if I only got 4 hours of sleep the night before, I will go to bed early. If not, then I will spend the evening reading until normal bedtime.

Thinking of the FitBit app - there could be conditionals about the encouraging messages printed in the app. If I'm close to my daily step goal, it will say "You're almost there!". If I'm still just getting started, it will say, "You've got this."

4. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

For multiple conditions, you use the else if keywords to provide additional conditions. The program will read them in order and check the if each condition is truthy. If the first condition is "true", then that code will run and the program will not continue through the remaining conditions. If the first condition is "false", then the program will move on to the second condition to assess if "true" or not. If "true", then the program will run that code and not continue through the remaining options. So on and so forth down through all conditions until it finds one that evaluates to "true".

5. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

I think this is referring to using the logical operators. If you want to make sure that TWO conditions are being met, you can use the && operator to ensure that both conditions evaluate to "true". If you just want to verify one of two conditions are being met, you could use the || operator so that one condition, at least, evaluates to "true".

6. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?

Along the lines of naming, I'm wondering how difficult that gets with a large script. Are there any other considerations to keep in mind when attempting to name functions and their parameters?

What would be the benefit to calling a function before declaring it?
