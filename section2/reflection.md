## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between

I think I generally used to ask them too soon and now I haven't really asked too many questions thus far into the pre-work. However, I think it's just going to be something
I have to balance as I make it through Turing. I definitely am going to practice Time-boxing, to make sure I don't waste too much of the day falling into GOOGLE rabbit-holes.

1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

I can see that. I actually felt really comfortable. I felt like my learning was in my own hands. There was a moment where I fully didn't understand how short-circuit could be useful,
but then I watched some Youtube videos and it made more sense. It is still less logical to me than the way Java works, but it's cool to see the different applications of JavaScript
and how that behavior would be useful in a form on a website. In addition to that, I ended up asking anyone on slack if they can offer a better explanation, to further elucidate
any misunderstandings, so that I can have a more concrete understanding of what's going on.

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.
A conditional is an if then type statement. That means if a certain condition is happening, then you do a certain behavior if that condition is false, then you do another behavior.
A real world example is you can check if it's raining. If it is, then you _take an umbrella with you_, if not then _proceed as usual_.
A real world conditional I often encounter, is one on Instagram when I try accessing it on the computer. If I'm logged in I can peruse IG as usual, if not then IG asks me to log in
to get to any other page other than the one I've landed on.

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

You can stack multiple conditions with an if, else-if, else ladder. The way a program reads this ladder is that it starts by checking the condition in the
if statement, if that's true then it runs what is in the code block, if not it moves on to the next else-if statement. If the statement in between the else-if parenthesis is true
then whatever is in the else-if code block runs. If not it goes on to the next else-if and checks that statement (boolean expression) to see if that's true. It continues this way
down the ladder. If none of the else-if statements are true, then the code between the else block executes.

1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

I can use the && (AND) or || (OR) logical operators. I use the && to meet two conditions, and if I want to meet just one of two conditions then I use ||.

1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?

I didn't see anything about styling conventions about naming Javascript functions, are there any that I should be aware of?
