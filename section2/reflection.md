## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

I am comfortable asking questions when I am unsure. I feel that most of the time I ask questions appropriately, however sometimes I miss the boat and don't end up asking the question at all.

1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

I felt like a kid without their training wheels at first. I forgot how to run nodes so I had to refer back to section 1/google to figure out how to run the node. Once I got comfortable I hit the ground running and it was easier to learn and be comfortable in coding without the extra hints.

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

A conditional statement evaluates to true or false. An example of daily life conditional statements: Do I want a second cup of coffee? An example of a conditional statement in a web application: Is user logged in.

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

To add multiple conditions to an if statement you would add && (and) or || (or). Example: condition1 && condition2. This would read condition1 must be met AND condition2 must be met in order to be true. Example 2: condition3 || condition4. Condition3 must be met OR condtion4 must be met in order to be true.

1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

Google is a good tool to utilize

1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?

I am still unclear of the difference between "else" and "else if".
