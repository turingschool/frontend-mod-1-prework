//-------------------
// PART 1: Function Syntax
//-------------------

// EXAMPLE: Write a function below that, when called will log "Severus Snape" to the console
function printName() {
  console.log("Severus Snape");
};

printName();
printName();
printName();
printName();
// Since the function was called 4 times, "Severus Snape" will log 4 times.


// YOU DO: Write a function named sayHello that logs to the console "Oh, Hello!"
// Then, call the function 2 times.

function sayHello() {
  console.log("Oh, Hello!");
}

sayHello();
sayHello();

//-------------------
// PART 2: Arguments and Parameters
//-------------------

// YOU DO: Write a function named greetMe that takes an argument, a String, of a name.
// The function should print out the value of the String that was passed in.
// Then, call the function 3 times, each time, passing it a different name.

function greetMe(name) {
  console.log(name);
}

greetMe("Sarah");
greetMe("Devin");
greetMe("Joey");
// YOU DO: Write a function that takes in 2 numbers as arguments, Numbers, and logs their sum
// Then, call that function 3 times, each time, passing in 2 different Numbers.

function addItUp(num1, num2){
  console.log(num1 + num2);
}

addItUp(3, 4);
addItUp(9, 5);
addItUp(2, 6);


// YOU DOðŸŽˆ: Write a function that takes in two strings and prints a concatenation
// of those two strings, for example the arguments could be ("Oscar", "Ruck") and
// the end result might be "Oscar and Ruck are BFFS".  Then, call that function.

function iceCreamCone(flavor1, flavor2){
  console.log("I want " + flavor1 + " and " + flavor2 + " in my ice cream cone.");
}

iceCreamCone ("chocolate", "strawberry");
iceCreamCone ("chocolate", "peanutbutter");

//-------------------
// PART 3: Naming is Hard
//-------------------

/*
Naming is notoriously hard in programming. It is a skill to name a variable or function concisely enough
that it is reasonable to type, but descriptive enough that others can infer the meaning.

Look at the code you wrote for the previous YOU DOðŸŽˆ - what did you name the function, and why?
What did you name each parameter, and why?

EXPLAIN:

I named the function, iceCreamCone because I wanted the user to input what two flavors of ice cream
he/she would like inside of their ice cream cone. I named my parameters flavor1 and flavor2 because the user will
input the flavor of ice cream that they want in their cone. I could have been more descriptive in my console
log message, however, I feel like this reads out the same way it would be if you were telling the guy
behind the counter what you wanted to order.
