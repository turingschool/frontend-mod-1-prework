//-------------------
// PART 1: Function Syntax
//-------------------

// EXAMPLE: Write a function below that, when called will log "Severus Snape" to the console
function printName() {
  console.log("Severus Snape");
};

printName();
printName();
printName();
printName();
// Since the function was called 4 times, "Severus Snape" will log 4 times.


// YOU DO: Write a function named sayHello that logs to the console "Oh, Hello!"
// Then, call the function 2 times.
function sayHello() {
  console.log("Oh, Hello!");
}

sayHello();
sayHello();

//-------------------
// PART 2: Arguments and Parameters
//-------------------

// YOU DO: Write a function named greetMe that takes an argument, a String, of a name.
// The function should print out the value of the String that was passed in.
// Then, call the function 3 times, each time, passing it a different name.
function greetMe(name) {
  console.log(name);
}

greetMe('Tanya Tucker');
greetMe('John Oliver');
greetMe('Tippy Carpenter');

// YOU DO: Write a function that takes in 2 numbers as arguments, Numbers, and logs their sum
// Then, call that function 3 times, each time, passing in 2 different Numbers.
function addedNums(num1, num2) {
  console.log(num1 + num2);
}
addedNums(3,4);
addedNums(14,13);
addedNums(22,9);

// YOU DOðŸŽˆ: Write a function that takes in two strings and prints a concatenation
// of those two strings, for example the arguments could be ("Oscar", "Ruck") and
// the end result might be "Oscar and Ruck are BFFS".  Then, call that function.
function favFoodAndDrink(food, drink) {
  console.log("Nadia loves to eat " + food + " while drinking an icy, cold "+ drink + "!");
}

favFoodAndDrink('hummus', 'vimto');


//-------------------
// PART 3: Naming is Hard
//-------------------

/*
Naming is notoriously hard in programming. It is a skill to name a variable or function concisely enough
that it is reasonable to type, but descriptive enough that others can infer the meaning.

Look at the code you wrote for the previous YOU DOðŸŽˆ - what did you name the function, and why?
What did you name each parameter, and why?

EXPLAIN: I named the function favFoodAnddrink becuase that is what the consoled string returned from the function describes.
The first parameter was named food because it should have a value we know as an ingestible substance. The second parameter was named
drink because it should have a value that represents an ingestible liquid :). These all seemed self explanatory and easy to understand
when you looked at the console log within the code block, parameter names, and the function name alltogether.
