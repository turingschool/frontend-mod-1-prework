//-------------------
// PART 1: Function Syntax
//-------------------

// EXAMPLE: Write a function below that, when called will log "Severus Snape" to the console
function printName() {
  console.log("Severus Snape");
};

printName();
printName();
printName();
printName();
// Since the function was called 4 times, "Severus Snape" will log 4 times.


// YOU DO: Write a function named sayHello that logs to the console "Oh, Hello!"
// Then, call the function 2 times.
function sayHello() {
  console.log("Oh, Hello!");
};

sayHello();
sayHello();

//-------------------
// PART 2: Arguments and Parameters
//-------------------

// YOU DO: Write a function named greetMe that takes an argument, a String, of a name.
// The function should print out the value of the String that was passed in.
// Then, call the function 3 times, each time, passing it a different name.
function greetMe(name) {
  console.log("Hello " + name + ", how are you?");
};

greetMe("John");
greetMe("Buggleburg");
greetMe("MacLandius Scrantonthorn");


// YOU DO: Write a function that takes in 2 numbers as arguments, Numbers, and logs their sum
// Then, call that function 3 times, each time, passing in 2 different Numbers.
function sumItUp(num1, num2) {
  console.log(num1 + num2);
};

sumItUp(42, 56);
sumItUp(-398, 42645);
sumItUp(.004424002640097876, .003099903860002845)


// YOU DOðŸŽˆ: Write a function that takes in two strings and prints a concatenation
// of those two strings, for example the arguments could be ("Oscar", "Ruck") and
// the end result might be "Oscar and Ruck are BFFS".  Then, call that function.

function twoStringsWalkIntoABar(name1, name2) {
//         ^^^^^ Not a good name for a function, I know... :(
// An alternate name could be something like "twoIntoBar" or "intoBarJoke".
  console.log(name1 + ' says to ' + name2 + ", 'I don't have a punchline, my bad.'");
};

twoStringsWalkIntoABar("Barbara", "Gilligan");


//-------------------
// PART 3: Naming is Hard
//-------------------

/*
Naming is notoriously hard in programming. It is a skill to name a variable or function concisely enough
that it is reasonable to type, but descriptive enough that others can infer the meaning.

Look at the code you wrote for the previous YOU DOðŸŽˆ - what did you name the function, and why?
What did you name each parameter, and why?
