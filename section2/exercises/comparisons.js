//-------------------
// PART 1: Comparing variables
//-------------------

var numberTeachers = 4;
var numberStudents = 20;
var stringTeachers = "4";
var numberDogs = 0;

// EXAMPLE: log the result of the comparison: is numberTeachers greater than numberStudents?
console.log("Is numberTeachers greater than numberStudents?", numberTeachers > numberStudents);
// this should log: "Is numberTeachers greater than numberStudents?" false

// YOU DO: log the result of the comparison: is numberTeachers less than numberStudents?
// this should log: true
console.log("Is numberTeachers less than numberStudents", numberTeachers < numberStudents);
// YOU DO: log the result of the comparison: is numberTeachers equal to stringTeachers? (use the == operator)
// this should log: true
console.log("Is numberTeachers equal to stringTeachers", numberTeachers == stringTeachers);
/*
Note: this is an example of type coercion. Although stringTeachers is a string and numberStudents is an integer,
this statement still evaluated to true. JavaScript forces the stringTeachers into an integer to
perform this evaluation
*/

// YOU DO: log the result of the comparison: is numberTeachers strictly equal to stringTeachers? (use the === operator)
// this should log: false
console.log("Is numberTeachers strictly equal to stringTeachers", numberTeachers === stringTeachers);
/*
Note: the strictly equal to operator compares the value of the variable in addition to the type of the variable.
since the numberTeachers is an integer value and the stringTeachers is a string value, although they are both equal to 4,
the comparison still evaluates to false.

In JavaScript, it is a best practice to use the strict comparison. It is said that, anytime a developer
thinks they _need_ to use the `==` loose comparison, they are doing something they shouldn't be. To help
you develop good habits that follow best practice, from now on, use the strict comparison.
*/

// YOU DO: log the result of the comparison: is numberTeachers not equal to numberStudents?
// this should log: true
console.log("Is numberTeachers not equal to numberStudents", numberTeachers !== numberStudents);
// YOU DO: log the result of the comparison: is numberStudents greater than or equal to 20?
// this should log: true
console.log("Is numberStudents greater than or equal to 20", numberStudents >= 20);
// YOU DO: log the result of the comparison: is numberStudents greater than or equal to 21?
// this should log: false
console.log("Is numberStudents greater than or equal to 21", numberStudents >= 21);
// YOU DO: log the result of the comparison: is numberStudents less than or equal to 20?
// this should log: true
console.log("Is numberStudents less than or equal to 20", numberStudents <= 20);
// YOU DO: log the result of the comparison: is numberStudents less than or equal to 21?
// this should log: true
console.log("Is numberStudents less than or equal to 21", numberStudents <= 21);

//-------------------
// PART 2: Articulating what you are doing
//-------------------

// For the following prompts, you will be given a line of code and your task is to type out a Comment,
// in English, explaining what that line of code is doing, including what the comparison will evaluate to.
// Be as technically precise as possible, but don't just copy and paste a definition from the readings.
// Make sure YOU can explain it that way!

console.log(4 < 9);
//YOU DO: Explain.
/* The prompt is loging the variables of 4 and 9, with the operator being less than.
 The console log should read 4 is less than 9, with the boolean being True*/
var books = 3;
console.log(4 < books);
// YOU DO: Explain.
/*A variable has been created, the variable being books and the value behind the variable being 3
What the prompt is loging is 4 less than books(3). The boolean would then read False because 4 is not less than 3*/
var friends = 6;
var siblings = 2;
console.log(friends > siblings);
// YOU DO: Explain.
/*Two variables have been created, one being friends and the other being siblings.
siblings equals 2 and friends equals 6
The prompt is loging friends is greater than siblings.
The log would then state 6 > 2 and the boolean would then state True*/
var attendees = 9;
var meals = 8;
console.log(attendees !== meals);
// YOU DO: Explain.
/*Two variables have been created, one being attendees and the other being meals
attendees equals 9 and meals equals 8
The prompt is loging atteendees is not equal to meals
The log would then state 9 !== 8 and the boolean would then state true*/

//-------------------
// PART 3: Logical Operators
//-------------------

var isHungry = true;
var finishedHomework = false;

// EXAMPLE:
// Determine if the user is hungry and has completed their homework
console.log(isHungry && finishedHomework);
// Determine if the user is hungry or has completed their homework
console.log(isHungry || finishedHomework);

var lovesToPlay = true;
var lovesDogPark = false;
var lovesTreats = true;
var age = 1;

// YOU DO:
// Determine if the dog loves to play and loves treats
console.log(lovesToPlay && lovesTreats);

// Determine if the dog loves to play and loves the dog park
console.log(lovesToPlay && lovesDogPark);

// Determine if the dog loves to play or loves the dog park
console.log(lovesToPlay || lovesDogPark);

// Determine if the dog loves to play and is a puppy
console.log(lovesToPlay || age);
// What did your final line of code evaluate to? Why do you think that is? Explain.
// ANSWER:
/*I evalutated it under a logical script operator because if I were to use the
definer operator the answer would have came out to a 1. Reason being is because of
unicode, unicode would have taken the higher value which in this case is the age.
Then we would received a string as an answer instead of a boolean*/
