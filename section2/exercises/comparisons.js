//-------------------
// PART 1: Comparing variables
//-------------------

var numberTeachers = 4;
var numberStudents = 20;
var stringTeachers = "4";
var numberDogs = 0;

// EXAMPLE: log the result of the comparison: is numberTeachers greater than numberStudents?
console.log("Is numberTeachers greater than numberStudents?", numberTeachers > numberStudents);
// this should log: "Is numberTeachers greater than numberStudents?" false

// YOU DO: log the result of the comparison: is numberTeachers less than numberStudents?
console.log("Is numberTeachers less than numberStudents", numberTeachers < numberStudents);
// this should log: true

// YOU DO: log the result of the comparison: is numberTeachers equal to stringTeachers? (use the == operator)
console.log("Is numberTeachers equal to stringTeachers?", numberTeachers == stringTeachers);
// this should log: true

/*
Note: this is an example of type coercion. Although stringTeachers is a string and numberStudents is an integer,
this statement still evaluated to true. JavaScript forces the stringTeachers into an integer to
perform this evaluation
*/

// YOU DO: log the result of the comparison: is numberTeachers strictly equal to stringTeachers? (use the === operator)
console.log("Is numberTeachers strictly equal to stringTeachers?", numberTeachers === stringTeachers);
// this should log: false

/*
Note: the strictly equal to operator compares the value of the variable in addition to the type of the variable.
since the numberTeachers is an integer value and the stringTeachers is a string value, although they are both equal to 4,
the comparison still evaluates to false.

In JavaScript, it is a best practice to use the strict comparison. It is said that, anytime a developer
thinks they _need_ to use the `==` loose comparison, they are doing something they shouldn't be. To help
you develop good habits that follow best practice, from now on, use the strict comparison.
*/

// YOU DO: log the result of the comparison: is numberTeachers not equal to numberStudents?
console.log("Is numberTeachers not equal to numberStudents?", numberTeachers !== numberStudents);
// this should log: true

// YOU DO: log the result of the comparison: is numberStudents greater than or equal to 20?
console.log("Is numberStudents greater than or equal to 20?", numberStudents >= 20);
// this should log: true

// YOU DO: log the result of the comparison: is numberStudents greater than or equal to 21?
console.log("Is numberStudents greater than or equal to 21?", numberStudents >= 21);
// this should log: false

// YOU DO: log the result of the comparison: is numberStudents less than or equal to 20?
console.log("Is numberStudents less than or equal to 20?", numberStudents <= 20);
// this should log: true

// YOU DO: log the result of the comparison: is numberStudents less than or equal to 21?
console.log("Is numberStudents less than or equal to 21?", numberStudents <= 21);
// this should log: true


//-------------------
// PART 2: Articulating what you are doing
//-------------------

// For the following prompts, you will be given a line of code and your task is to type out a Comment,
// in English, explaining what that line of code is doing, including what the comparison will evaluate to.
// Be as technically precise as possible, but don't just copy and paste a definition from the readings.
// Make sure YOU can explain it that way!

console.log(4 < 9);
//YOU DO: Explain.
//This line compares two integers (4 and 9) using the less than comparison operator (<), and will print out a
// boolean value.  The comparison asks if 4 is less than 9.
// This shoud log: true.

var books = 3;
console.log(4 < books);
// YOU DO: Explain
/* A variable named "books" is declared with an integer data type with a value of 3.
The next line logs whether or not 4 is less than the variable "book"'s value.  The
comparison will evalute to false. */

var friends = 6;
var siblings = 2;
console.log(friends > siblings);
// YOU DO: Explain.
/* A variable named "friends" is declared with an integer data type with a value of 6.
A variable named "siblings" is declared with an integer data type with a value of 2.
The third line logs whether or not the variable "friends" holds a value that is greater than the variable "siblings"'s value.  The
comparison will evalute to true. */

var attendees = 9;
var meals = 8;
console.log(attendees !== meals);
// YOU DO: Explain.
/* A variable named "attendees" is declared with an integer data type with a value of 9.
A variable named "meals" is declared with an integer data type with a value of 8.
The third line logs whether or not the variable "attendees" holds a more that's not equal to the variable "meal"'s value.  The
comparison will evalute to true. */

//-------------------
// PART 3: Logical Operators
//-------------------

var isHungry = true;
var finishedHomework = false;

// EXAMPLE:
// Determine if the user is hungry and has completed their homework
console.log(isHungry && finishedHomework);
// Determine if the user is hungry or has completed their homework
console.log(isHungry || finishedHomework);

var lovesToPlay = true;
var lovesDogPark = false;
var lovesTreats = true;
var age = 1;

// YOU DO:
// Determine if the dog loves to play and loves treats
console.log(lovesToPlay && lovesTreats);

// Determine if the dog loves to play and loves the dog park
console.log(lovesToPlay && lovesDogPark);

// Determine if the dog loves to play or loves the dog park
console.log(lovesToPlay || lovesDogPark);

// Determine if the dog loves to play and is a puppy
console.log(lovesToPlay && age);
// What did your final line of code evaluate to? Why do you think that is? Explain.
// ANSWER: The final line of code evaluated to 1: which means true.

// FINAL CHECK

// Did you run this file in your terminal to make sure everything printed out to the console
// as you would expect?
// yes
