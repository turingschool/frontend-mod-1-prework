//-------------------
// PART 1: Comparing variables
//-------------------

var numberTeachers = 4;
var numberStudents = 20;
var stringTeachers = "4";
var numberDogs = 0;

// EXAMPLE: log the result of the comparison: is numberTeachers greater than numberStudents?
console.log("Is numberTeachers greater than numberStudents?", numberTeachers > numberStudents);
// this should log: "Is numberTeachers greater than numberStudents?" false

// YOU DO: log the result of the comparison: is numberTeachers less than numberStudents?
console.log("Is numberTeachers less than numberStudents?", numberTeachers < numberStudents);
// this should log: true

// YOU DO: log the result of the comparison: is numberTeachers equal to stringTeachers? (use the == operator)
console.log("Is numberTeachers equal to stringTeachers?", numberTeachers == stringTeachers);
// this should log: true

/*
Note: this is an example of type coercion. Although stringTeachers is a string and numberStudents is an integer,
this statement still evaluated to true. JavaScript forces the stringTeachers into an integer to
perform this evaluation
*/

// YOU DO: log the result of the comparison: is numberTeachers strictly equal to stringTeachers? (use the === operator)
console.log("Is numberTeachers strictly equal to stringTeachers?", numberTeachers === stringTeachers);
// this should log: false

/*
Note: the strictly equal to operator compares the value of the variable in addition to the type of the variable.
since the numberTeachers is an integer value and the stringTeachers is a string value, although they are both equal to 4,
the comparison still evaluates to false.

In JavaScript, it is a best practice to use the strict comparison. It is said that, anytime a developer
thinks they _need_ to use the `==` loose comparison, they are doing something they shouldn't be. To help
you develop good habits that follow best practice, from now on, use the strict comparison.
*/

// YOU DO: log the result of the comparison: is numberTeachers not equal to numberStudents?
console.log("Is numberTeachers not equal to numberStudents?", numberTeachers !== numberStudents);
// this should log: true

// YOU DO: log the result of the comparison: is numberStudents greater than or equal to 20?
console.log("Is numberStudents greater than or equal to 20?", numberStudents >= 20);
// this should log: true

// YOU DO: log the result of the comparison: is numberStudents greater than or equal to 21?
console.log("Is numberStudents greater than or equal to 21?", numberStudents >= 21);
// this should log: false

// YOU DO: log the result of the comparison: is numberStudents less than or equal to 20?
console.log("Is numberStudents less than or equal to 20?", numberStudents <= 20);
// this should log: true

// YOU DO: log the result of the comparison: is numberStudents less than or equal to 21?
console.log("Is numberStudents less than or equal to 21?", numberStudents <= 21);
// this should log: true


//-------------------
// PART 2: Articulating what you are doing
//-------------------

// For the following prompts, you will be given a line of code and your task is to type out a Comment,
// in English, explaining what that line of code is doing, including what the comparison will evaluate to.
// Be as technically precise as possible, but don't just copy and paste a definition from the readings.
// Make sure YOU can explain it that way!

console.log(4 < 9);
//YOU DO: Explain. In this log, the less than comparison operator is used to log if the integer 4 is
// less than the integer 9. This will evaluate to true, as 4 is less than 9.

var books = 3;
console.log(4 < books);
// YOU DO: Explain. In the first line, the variable keyword is used to declare the variable name
// of books, assigning of value of books to 3. The second line will log that shows the less than
// comparison operator being used to compare if 4 is less than books, which has the value of 3.
// The comparison will evaluate to false, since 4 is not less than 3.

var friends = 6;
var siblings = 2;
console.log(friends > siblings);
// YOU DO: Explain. In the first line, the variable keyword is used to declare the variable name
// of friends, assigning the value of friends to 6. In the second line, the variable keyword is used to declare
// the variable name of siblings, assigning the value of siblings to 2. The third line will log the comparison operator
// equation, which compares if friends (6) is greater than siblings (2). The comparison will evaluate to true,
// since 6 is greater than 2.

var attendees = 9;
var meals = 8;
console.log(attendees !== meals);
// YOU DO: Explain. In the first line, the variable keyword is used to declare the variable name of
// attendees, assigning the value of attendees to 9. In the second line, the variable keyword is used to declare
// the variable name of meals, assigning the value of meals to 8. The third line will log the comparison operator
// equation, which compares if attendees is not equal to meals. The comparison will evaluate to true, since
// 9 is not equal to 8.


//-------------------
// PART 3: Logical Operators
//-------------------

var isHungry = true;
var finishedHomework = false;

// EXAMPLE:
// Determine if the user is hungry and has completed their homework
console.log(isHungry && finishedHomework);
// Determine if the user is hungry or has completed their homework
console.log(isHungry || finishedHomework);

var lovesToPlay = true;
var lovesDogPark = false;
var lovesTreats = true;
var age = 1;


// YOU DO:
// Determine if the dog loves to play and loves treats
console.log(lovesToPlay && lovesTreats);

// Determine if the dog loves to play and loves the dog park
console.log(lovesToPlay && lovesDogPark);

// Determine if the dog loves to play or loves the dog park
console.log(lovesToPlay || lovesDogPark);

// Determine if the dog loves to play and is a puppy
console.log(lovesToPlay && age >= 1);

// What did your final line of code evaluate to? Why do you think that is? Explain.
// ANSWER: Using the logical AND operation with lovesToPlay and age, it evaluated to
// the integer 1. I think this is because if both values are not the same data type,
// specifically a boolean and an integer of 1, then the result of the operation
// will be the second value. I then added another comparison operator to evaluate it age
// was >= 1 which was my determining factor if the dog was a puppy. This then evaluated to true.

// FINAL CHECK
//-------------------

// Did you run this file in your terminal to make sure everything printed out to the console
// as you would expect?
