This exercise file is a little different from the others you have seen so far. Read carefully!

Below is a dynamic story that is created based on the value of three variables: doorChoice, bearClothing, bearChoice.
Spend some time changing the variables and running the file to see how the story changes.

Questions

1. In English, using technical vocabulary, describe what is happening between lines 14 and 18.

An expression is evaluated, which returns a value (boolean), a conditional statement (doorChoice === 1) says what to do in a given situation. If evaluated to true then it will be log that
"You see a bear putting on a hat" (it does this by reassigning a value to the variable bearClothing), if false (else) will log "You sea a bear putting on a scarf" (it does this by reassigning a value to the variable bearClothing).

2. What variable has a new value assigned to it after the first if statement executes?

bearClothing

3. If you changed the variable doorChoice to equal 3, what would the bearClothing value be?

bearClothing = "scarf"

Here the code is evaluating several conditions through If else statements, where if the first condition evaluate to true, the code will stop and log the

evaluate to true. And if none of them evaluate to true it will log "You stay with the bear and become it's best friend!".
