This exercise file is a little different from the others you have seen so far. Read carefully!

Below is a dynamic story that is created based on the value of three variables: doorChoice, bearClothing, bearChoice.
Spend some time changing the variables and running the file to see how the story changes.

var doorChoice = 1;
var bearClothing = "";
var bearChoice = 2;

console.log("It looks like that " + bearClothing + " is too small for the bear, do you...");

console.log("1. Offer your own to the bear?");
console.log("2. Point it out to the bear?");
console.log("3. Make a dash for the next room?");

Questions

1. In English, using technical vocabulary, describe what is happening between lines 14 and 18.
A condition is set that IF the doorChoice is 1 then the story will use "hat" as the garment the bear is wearing.

2. What variable has a new value assigned to it after the first if statement executes?
bearClothing

3. If you changed the variable doorChoice to equal 3, what would the bearClothing value be?
Scarf

4. In English, using technical vocabulary, describe what is happening between lines lines 27 and 35.
An if/else condition is written telling the computer to check the value of bearChoice and what script
to run if the value is strictly equal to 1 (secret passage out), else if strictly equal to 2 it will
run the next script (starts to cry), else if the value of bearChoice is strictly equal to 3 it will
run the next script (room full of snakes). If none of those conditions are met, the final else script
will run (bear becomes your best friend).
