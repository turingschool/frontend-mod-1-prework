## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?
* Using Pomodoro has certainly taken time to get used to, but I do appreciate its structured approach. Setting an intention to stay focused for a set period of time has allowed me to stay mindful of possible distractions. The expectation of an upcoming break has also assisted my focus as I'm constantly aware (both consciously and sub-consciously) that a reward is on the horizon. I may play around with focus time and break lengths, via the Marinara extension, but I plan on continuing to utilize the Pomodoro Technique.

2. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?
* Typically, I tend to organize my work schedule on a daily/weekly basis - this reduces the pressure I might feel during each individual study/work session. However, I did set intentions prior to each session during this section and found that my estimations were suprisingly on point. My level of focus didn't seem to fluctuate too greatly from how I normally structure my work schedule, but I do understand the importance of estimation and developing the skill to estimate (especially in development). I will be more mindful of my differences in focus when setting granular intentions for study versus daily/weekly intentions.

3. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?
* An object is a complex representation of data and is used to model real world "things". Like an Array, Objects contain and organize multiple values, but instead of accessing a value via its "index", a "key" is used. An Object consists of a list of "key-value" pairs that act somewhat like attributes, as each key-value pair can represent a different characteristic of its object. Objects can also contain functions that perform actions or manipulate the data organized within its key-value pairs.

4. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class
	  * Array: as the students belong to the same class, their names can simply
		be stored together in an array assigned to the "students" variable
  * List of states and their capitals
	  * Object: each capital is "linked" to its state, therefore a key-value pair
		would be beneficial for organizing this list
  * List of things to pack for vacation
	  * Array: unless you want to place each item into categories (like "toiletries",
		"electronics", etc), a simple array containing each item should suffice
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow
	  * Array: as this is only the accounts a single person follows, a simple
		array would suffice (however, if the list was exceedingly long, it might be
		beneficial to categorize the accounts)
  * List of student names and their cohort
	  * Object: as each student is linked to their cohort, you would want to
		have "cohort" keys and "students" arrays as values         
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake
	  * Object: each ingredient is linked to the amount used in the recipe, so
		key-value pairs would be beneficial
  * All my favorite restaurants
	  * Array: unless the restaurants need to be categorized, a simple array
		containing each restaurant should suffice

5. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties a bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?
* An Instagram post might be represented as an Object. Example key-value pairs could be: author = "jtschlandt", totalLikes = 8, images = ["my_new_website"], comments = ["That's awesome! Where did you learn how to code?"].

6. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?
* What is the difference between an Object and an Object Literal? Is an Object Literal simply an example of an Object (or instance of the Object Literal class)?
