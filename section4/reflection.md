## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?
   - I was much more aware of how time passed and how I spent it. I have a better sense of where and when my mind starts wandering, but I also have a better sense of what projects take what amount of time. I also realize that I need to hold myself better accountable for taking breaks correctly. It is really easy to just push through a break. And also very easy to take much too long of a break.

2. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?
   - I am underestimating the amount of time it takes me to take notes and overestimating the amount of time exercises take. That surprises me and makes me feel like I should work more slowly on exercises, to make sure I'm not cutting corners. I was also surprised to find that when I physically set a timer and saw it ticking, my brain started to feel different. It felt focused, with a gentle time pressure. I like this method!

3. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?
   - Objects and arrays are very similar - they both store data that can be manipulated. An array can only be accessed via the index number. However, an object's data can be accessed using strings. This set up allows us to treat objects like databases, storing and organizing data within.

4. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class:

  Array. This is a simple list of names. They relate to each other in that they are in the same class, but we don't need to have more information about each student in particular.


  * List of states and their capitals: Object. This example needs an array of states, but then within each state, the key value pair of the capital name.


  * List of things to pack for vacation: Array. This is a list of related objects that only need to be accessed with an index.


  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow: Array. This is a list of related objects that only need to be accessed with an index.


  * List of student names and their cohort: Object. This example needs an array of students, but each student has further information attached as a key value pair, cohort.


  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake: Object. This example needs the list of ingredients and the quantity associated with each ingredient.

  * All my favorite restaurants: Array. A more simple list of restaurants that only need to be accessed with an index.

5. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?
   -  An object I thought of during the exercises is a page on the American Kennel Club website. Each breed will be an object with keys such as popularity, height, weight, lifeExpectancy, nutrition, grooming, exercise.

1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?
   - I'm still confused about what an element is, and how objects are different from arrays. But an array can hold an object and an element? I'm  not sure how all these terms relate to each other.
   - I would also like to better understand the use of color in syntax - I feel like I almost understand, but I would like to understand thoroughly.
   - I would also like to know more about formatting - for readability - I think my tweet example especially could use some better formatting direction.
