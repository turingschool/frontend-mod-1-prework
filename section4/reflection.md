## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?

My workflow has felt a little choppy. I havent been working for more than about 2 hours at a time at the longest without getting up and taking a break. Sometimes it was hard for me to get back in the groove after taking a break and sometimes the break was just what I needed. I think for me it is important to keep on going when I feel like I am in the zone, and take those poms when I feel myself start to slow down or I feel my brain get a little foggy.

1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?

I felt that I was very good at setting daily goals of what I wanted to get done in that day to make sure I would have enough time to complete and touch up my work. Most times I finished these goals early and had extra time to decompress and digest what I had learned. Some times I didnt make it as far as I wanted to with a clear head so I had to stop and come back to it hours later or even the next day. I tried not to push myself too far in any one coding session and I think it really benefited my focus and time management.

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?

An object is a specific instance of a class. It is different from an array because although an object is a list of properties it is a list of key-value pairs, where each property has a specific value unique to that object.

1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class
  
  Array - an array named students could be made to hold the values of the names of each student, there is no additional information that needs to be tied to each name.
  
  * List of states and their capitals
  
  Object - You could create a class called State that creates individual state objects with one of the properties being capitals.
  
  * List of things to pack for vacation
  
  Array - There are no additional properties needed, it is just a list of strings.
  
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow
  
  Array - There are no additional properties needed, it is just a list of strings.
  
  * List of student names and their cohort
  
  Object -  You could create a class class Student that creates individual student objects where cohort is a property.
  
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake
  
  Object - You could create a class Ingredient that creates ingredient objects that store the value for how much of the ingredient to use.
  
  * All my favorite restaurants
  
  Array - It is just a list of strings, no need for additional properties.

1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values? 

An object called facebookPost
The keys could be numberOfLikes, shares, authorName
the example values could be 15, ["Joe", "Pat", "Tim"], "John Doe" 

1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?

Is an object technically a data type? 
Is the constructor operator needed?
