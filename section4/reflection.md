## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?
It felt rushed and awkward. I was able to get a lot of work done when my little kids were taking naps (about 1.5-3 hours per day) and after they went to bed for the night (after 9). I couldn't do the Pomodoro technique because time is limited at my house and I have to get in the time when I can. I would work about an 1.5 - 2 hours before taking a break (or even 3, but that only occured once).

1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?
Like I said time is limited at my house so it was easier for me to focus and try to get things done before tiny children woke up. I was surprised with how focused I was trying to learn as much as I could while I could.

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?
Objects represent things with characteristics (properties). You can use strings instead of index positions (like in arrays) to get data. Arrays store an ordered list of data.

1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class - Array: this is just a simple list of items
  * List of states and their capitals - Object: this data has a key/value pair (states/capital)
  * List of things to pack for vacation - Array: another simple list
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow - Array: another list
  * List of student names and their cohort - Object: this data has a key/value pair (Student names/cohort)
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake - object: this has a key/value pair (ingredients/amount of each ingredient)
  * All my favorite restaurants - Array - another list

1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties a bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?

Facebook

key/values:
friends list/true
number of friends/ 653
date of post/ 4-8-21

1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?

I am still unsure why in some methods the method name brackets sometimes has a value and sometimes doesn't. Also in the tweet.js exercise why does the last parameter (comments) have to have brackets around them? The other strings do not have a bracket around them. 

Example:

record(); {
  this.isRecorded = true;
}
