## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?
Following the Pomodoro technique made me much more efficient. I was able to accomplish more this week then previous weeks.

1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?
Setting intentions helped organize my thoughts from a general list of things to do, to a written down action list that didn't require any brain power from me to remember. I was able to remain more focused using Pom breaks, though, I did start getting distracted by the timer the longer the day went.

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?
An object is a way to store more data about something. An array can only list attributes, but an Object can give values to those attributes and then use methods to manipulate the values.

1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class
  An array would be best because studentNames is a fairly narrow grouping and you're only looking for their names, not other data.

  * List of states and their capitals
  An array would be best because you only need Capital, State for each state, which is not a lot of data.

  * List of things to pack for vacation
  An object would be best because you need different data types for a vacation. Those data types can be organized better in an object.

  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow
  An array would be better because it's only Instagram account names being followed which is easy to track in an array.

  * List of student names and their cohort
  An object would be better because there are multiple pieces of data being collected which can be easier organized in an object.

  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake
  An object would be better because there are different types of data needed which an object is easier to use with.

  * All my favorite restaurants
  An array would be better because it's one type of data to organize.

1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties a bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?
I would imagine that Youtube tracks my recommended feed with an object. I think keys that may be on it are my subcriptions, watchTime, genresOfOtherVideosIWatch, engagementStats, and probably a ton more to recommend videos that they think I'll watch.  

1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?
I'm struggling with classes syntax. I really struggled with the tweet.js.
