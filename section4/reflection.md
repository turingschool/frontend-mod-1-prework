## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?
* Well, I didn't do the Pomodoro method this week. I have done it in the past and I learned it wasn't my thing. My working style is more along the lines of getting into a groove and continuing to work until I hit a rut. While working I can't be distracted (by a timer or something else) or I fall out of that groove and its REALLY hard for me to get back into it. Sometimes those grooves last 6 hours, sometimes only 30 min, but either way I have found not having a timer going off and interrupting my workflow is better for me.

1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?
* Again, sorry I didn't do the Pomodoro technique, but I did set intentions (because that's a habit I already do :) )! I attribute that to my obsessive list making. Writing down the night before the tasks and activities I need to get done the next day is how I've found I'm much more productive. I recently started using an hourly planner to schedule what times to start working on a task and what time to call it quits. This has helped me to stay focused and sane, especially if a task is a little daunting.

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?
* An **Object** is used to represent a thing: a person, city, vehicle, game, or anything that can be defined by a set of characteristics. Those "characteristics", are known as properties that have a key and a value.
```javascript
//syntax
var object = {
  key: "value"
};

//example
var person = {
  name: "Bowen",
  age: 7,
  hairColor: "blonde"
};
```
* An **Array** is used to represent a list of similar items stored in a single variable. ` var drinks = ["water", "gatorade", "coffee", "tea"]; `

1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class
    - *Array* . Its a list of similar items.
  * List of states and their capitals
    - *Object* . Its a thing with different characteristics.  
  * List of things to pack for vacation
    - *Array* . Its a list of similar items.
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow
    - *Array* . Its a list of similar items.
  * List of student names and their cohort
    - *Object* . Its a thing with different characteristics
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake
    - *Object* . Its a thing with different characteristics
  * All my favorite restaurants
    - *Array* . Its a list of similar items.

1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?
* **Duolingo** : has an account object. the keys would be: name, dateJoined, friends, languagesLearning, statistics (all the info on the languages you are learning), and achievements. All of these keys have different values for each user/account. 

1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?
