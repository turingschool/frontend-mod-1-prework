## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?

I felt like I was in a much better groove and was able to get through my technical work with fewer distractions! I did not expect taking breaks inbetween my work to have such a significant impact on my performance. I feel that I was able to get through my work more efficiently and feel less fatigue afterwards. I plan on practicing this technique from here on out!

1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?

I felt way more focused having a specific goal for the various exercises throughout section 4. This helped me keep on task but also made my goals more attainable. Although my time estimates were sometimes accurate and other times not, it helped me to recognize how to anticipate(or not) such exercises moving forward. This is an interesting and effective way to plan work!

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?

An object stores data in form of properties. These properties can hold string, boolean, and number values. These can be used to represent an entire class or instance of that class. An object is used defined with a set of properties where an array is essentially just a list of multiple items.

1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class: Array because this is merely listing data, not holding any additional characteristics/value
  * List of states and their capitals: Object because there is a property associated to the state - its capital.
  * List of things to pack for vacation: Array because again, this is just a list of items - no additional meaning.
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow: Array because this is just a list of accounts.
  * List of student names and their cohort: Object because each of the students have an assigned property - in this case, a cohort.
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake: Object because you are not only listing the ingredients but also the quantity of each that you need - property.
  * All my favorite restaurants: Array because this is only a list!

1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?

var Facebook = {
  user: "Juliana"
  photos: 200
  friends: 100
  comments: ["hello!", "how are you!?", "Hope all is well!"]
};

The Facebook app has various keys such as the above user, photos, friends, comments keys. The values for this specific instance are Juliana, 200, 100, and "hello!", "how are you!?", "Hope all is well!".

1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?
Just need more practice for structure, syntax, and fluidity!
