## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?

-It definately helped me as I was stuck on the last exercise and couldn't figure out how to write the code.  I took a few minutes break and came back refreshed.   

1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?

-There were times I took a break, figured out what was wrong with my code and just kept working through.  Sometimes I get in a mode where I know exactly what to do and really feed the need to finish

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?

-Objects represent variables with different properties while arrays only store lists of data within a single variable.

1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class
  -Array.  Student names will not change and can be stored in a single variable
  * List of states and their capitals
  -Object.  Each state will have a name and a capital.  It will be easier to use an object
  * List of things to pack for vacation
  -Array.  This list can be stored in one variable and will not to be changed
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow
  Array.  The names are static and can be stored in one variable
  * List of student names and their cohort
  Object.  Each student has a different name and cohort so multiple variables will be used
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake
  -Array.  Ingredients will not change and all stored in a cake variable
  * All my favorite restaurants
  -Array.  restaurant names are the same and can be stored in one variable

1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?

-Amazon purchase history. It would hold values of the item name, quatity, date purchased, shipping address, and total amount.
It might be 2 jackets purchased on 2/3/21 sent to your home address that costs total of one hundred dollars. 

1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?
this. statement.  What does it do and why do I set it to the same value.
ex. this.date = date
