## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?

I have been using the pomodoro technique throughout Mod 0 and prework. I did take it a bit more seriously this week and thought I was much more productive when following it closely. The sessions of 25 minutes seemed to fly by, and I was definitely tempted a few times o work through the breaks to complete an exercise or thought. I do understand, though, that taking these breaks allows for longevity. I know that I work best under structure, so I think I will be keeping up with the timing elements of the pomodoro technique moving forward.

2. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?

I struggle(d) with this part of the pomodoro technique. I feel like I do not have a good grasp on timing yet and it became more of a distraction to try to estimate timing than a benefit for me. Also, the Mod 1 Pre-work is already laid out in a step-by-step format, so it doesn't require much planning. I do see how this may be more beneficial once that is taken away, or in a job format. I think the planning time would seem more beneficial if you had 10 high priorities items to accomplish and needed a roadmap of how to get through them.

3. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?

Objects and arrays both store sets of information. Objects can store information in strings, so they have the ability to store and organize data differently. Alternatively, arrays are ordered lists and elements are accessed using index numbers. Objects group together variables and functions to create a picture of something we see in the real world.

4. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class
    - Array - this set of data works if it is an ordered list since it is only names
  * List of states and their capitals
    - Object - The object would be the state, and the capital would be additional information we store to start creating a model of that state
  * List of things to pack for vacation
    - Object - The object would be your suitcase, and the items you packed would create a full vision of the suitcase items
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow
    - Array - this set of data works as an ordered list since it is only names
  * List of student names and their cohort
    - Object - The student would be the object, and the cohort number would be additional information helping to paint the picture of the student
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake
    - Object - The baked good (cake) would be the object, and the ingredients and amounts would be additional information that help create the cake
  * All my favorite restaurants
    - Array - this set of data works if it is an ordered list since it is only names

5. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties a bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?

On Spotify, each podcast I listen to could be an object. Some possible keys would be -
Title: "Throughline"
Season: 2,
Episode: 4,
episodeName: "The Land of the Fee"
lastListened: "3/20/2021",
episodesStreamed: 22

6. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?
- What does "this." mean, and why is it used?
- If you wanted to add comments to the tweet.js exercise, how would you format the message? I understand how to make a method a set addition (+1 like), but am curious how you would add something that would have to be malleable, like a new comment.
