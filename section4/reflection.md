## Section 4 Reflection

**1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?**

 -Since I started pre-work I have done a Pomodoro technique, I've done 45 minutes of work with a 15 minute break. This was much better than 20 and 5 because it kept me engaged for longer. Shorter durations of work make me more space cased. After doing this for all of pre-work I have felt like I have absorbed more knowledge, and I understood my work at a higher level.

**2. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?**

 -As stated above I have been doing this since the start of pre-work. However, I will state I will be doing this for all lengthy intensive tasks throughout life. It makes digesting knowledge easier in general.

**3. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?**

 -An object is a working structure, and a variable that holds a large amount of information. The computer also knows what the object is given enough information. An array is different because its more of a list than a detailed structure.

**4. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.**

  * List of all of the students in class
 -`Array`, because you don't need info on the kids you just need a list.
  * List of states and their capitals
 -`Object`, because you are list states and giving information about them.
  * List of things to pack for vacation
 -`Array`, its a list of things you are taking with you. If you gave out descriptions of why you need each then an object would be better.
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow
 -`Array`, yet another list with no details following it. 
  * List of student names and their cohort
 -`Object`, you have a list with descriptions to each variable. An array can't define if the student is a FE or a BE.
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake
 -`Object`, it is a list yes. But you are putting discriptive information for each of you're ingredients.
  * All my favorite restaurants
 -`Array`, Its a list of your favorite restaurants. If you were to add string saying why its your favorite it would be different.

**5. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?**

 - `Object` being a search bar. You will need this for every web application because people need detailed search's for most websites. keys being `name`, `number`, `array` and `boolean`. You would need all of these for a proper search bar. The reason behind this is because of how people normally search. You need a naming convention to narrow down search, a `boolean` to determine if this is what you are specifically searching for. Numbers and arrays are used for closing down your search. Using an `array` of keywords would be needed.


**6. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?**

 -How do objects operate adaptively? Or do they operate adaptively? Ex: youtube algorithm.
