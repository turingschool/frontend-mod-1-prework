## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?

It's been more achievable. I pretty much forgive myself for taking many breaks throughout the day because of the Pomodoro and I am not feeling as burnt out by the end of the night.

1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?

I have it on my phone and as an extension for chrome. It is good for letting me know that I've earned a break. The issue is that my breaks tend to stretch to the 7-10 minute territory. I also find myself accidentally getting distracted by other articles or links when I am supposed to be focused. I think discipline may resolve these two issues but I am excited to exercise the timer.


1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?

An array is a collection of values ordered in an indexed list.
An object is a collection of data with key-value pairs. It's ordered by a list of strings.

1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class
  Array, there are no other properties besides the student's names.
  * List of states and their capitals
  Object, states and capitals are key-value pairs.
  * List of things to pack for vacation
  Array, it is just a list of strings
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow
  Array, another strings of account names
  * List of student names and their cohort
  Object, students are the key and their cohort is the value
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake
  Object, key value with a string (this is a given) and integer
  * All my favorite restaurants
  Array, it's a list of strings

1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties a bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?

Amazon. In the item specifications, it shows a list with properties that have key-value pairs when you view items. Keys are size, material, manufacturer, item weight. Values are 27 pounds, 12.6 x 11 x 14.2, Vitamix.

1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?

When writing code, should I always be using the constructor method to build instances rather than just writing a new object? Is it to save line space or because its more flexible?
