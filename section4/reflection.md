## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?

- Following this technique has been great with mitigating brain fatigue and helping my focus. Though, following it to a tee is a bit hard for the moment, sometimes I get into the zone and forget a break or two.

1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?

- I have been more focused overall, as for time frames I felt pretty on point for how long it takes to complete tasks

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?

- An Object is a collection of variables arranged in Key: value pairs. Unlike arrays, Objects do not have an order to them.

1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class
    - Array, sortable and has order which you would need for attendance and such.
  * List of states and their capitals
    - Object, State key and capital value pair. calling the state rather than an index.
  * List of things to pack for vacation
    - Array, Ordered ideal for a checklist.
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow
    - Array, only name values might need to be sorted.
  * List of student names and their cohort
    - Object, Name key and cohort value, easier to search by name.
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake
    - Object, ingredient key and amount value pairs, easy to read the entire object
  * All my favorite restaurants
    - Array, only listing names of locations, easier ordering.

1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?

- Reddit user would be an example
```javascript
username: "jeffperson",
email: "Jperson@mail.com",
posts: ["Hello world", "Best Post 2019"],
followers: ["JimJam31", "Todtheman90"],
karma: 1000

```

1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?

  - Can objects consist of other objects?
