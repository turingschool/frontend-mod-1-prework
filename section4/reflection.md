## Section 4 Reflection

### How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?


*I was a lot more aware of when I needed breaks and got a better sense of how to pace myself even though the Pomodoro technique wasn't really working for me when I was working on my own*



### Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?


*I did set alarms and then determined when they went off if it was actually a good time for me to stop. Usually, I was right in the middle of good progress, so I didn't stop, but I found it helpful to hear the alarm and then tell myself, "ok, finish this part up and then it's time for a break". This definitely helped me to stay focused and I worked a LOT faster this week.*



### What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?


*An Object is a way to store more complex data. It is similar to an array, except that it can use strings, which lets you treat an object like it's a database for storing and organizing data (not just accessed using the index of an item like with an array).*



### For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * **List of all of the students in class**

  *An Array would be better because we just need a collection of names without any additional data assigned to them.*

  * **List of states and their capitals**

  *An Object would be better because we need to store capitol data for each state*

  * **List of things to pack for vacation**

  *An Array because we just need a list of items without any additional data assigned to them*

  * **Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow**

  *An Array because we need a list of names without additional data assigned to them*

  * **List of student names and their cohort**

  *An Object would be better because we need to store cohort data for each student*

  * **Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake**

  *An Object because we need to store the amount of each ingredient with each ingredient*

  * **All my favorite restaurants**

  *An Array because we just need a list of restaurants without additional data*



### In this section, we talked about a `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties a bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?


*Another Object in a web application would be gists on GitHub. Keys may include gistDescription, fileNameWithExtension, body, indentMode, indentSize, and lineWrapMode. Some example values might be string variables for almost all of them except indentSize, which would have an integer variable.*



### What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?


*I don't know that I have any specific questions about classes or Objects, but I do know that I want to spend several hours practicing building them using the classMethods.js and tweet.js assignments as a reference as I'm preparing for Mod 1.*
