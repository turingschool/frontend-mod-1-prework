## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?
~ *I did this section in one day, and I haven't had time to purchase a physical kitchen timer yet. I will
   update this answer when I am able.*

2. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?
~ *See above*

3. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?
~ *An object differs from an array in that, instead of only using index numbers to search through the
   data, objects can be searched using strings called "keys".
  These keys are much like variables, in that they are defined by their given values, and are not values  
   in and of themselves. When these keys appear alongside their defined value, together they are called a "key pair". Objects are comprised of these key pairs, each key pair being contained within one,
   overarching "header variable" (a variable inside which all related key pairs are stored).*

4. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class
    *An array would do well here, I believe, since there is only one class to track.*
  * List of states and their capitals
    *An array would seem to be simpler/cleaner for something like this, since each state and its   
     corresponding capitol is entirely different from the next.*
  * List of things to pack for vacation
    *Again, an array, for the same reason as the first set of data.*
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow
    *Same answer as first and third sets of data, for the same reason, as well.*
  * List of student names and their cohort
    *Object, for sure, as there will not only be multiple lists of students, there will be multiple
     cohorts to track, as well.*
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake
    *Object again, for the same reasons as immediately above.*
  * All my favorite restaurants
    *Array, same reason as first, third, and fourth sets of data.*

5. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties a bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?
~ *The recommended section on YouTube. It might have keys whose values are arguments that get passed in by
   the algorithm as it tracks your viewing preferences (perhaps using some sort of key-code that
   references a particular video as the parameter it passes in, once it has determined what to recommend).*

6. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?
~ *Just curious now to see how many layers they can contain/how complex they can get! I have wondered as
   well about what syntax is used to insert user-generated info into an object. I presume this would be 
   accomplished using a method contained within the object itself, somehow, which could be called when
   appropriate.*
