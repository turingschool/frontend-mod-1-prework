## Section 4 Reflection

**1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?**  
It was very different. Firstly, just doing this pre-work without any step by step instruction was new. The Pomodoro technique helps me a lot because I think I tend to get too much in my head and not learn what I am putting down. So taking frequent breaks helps me a ton.  


**2. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?**  
I did actually find myself more focused. Kind of giving myself a timeline of "I have 25 min till a break," motivated me to try and get more done within those 25 minutes. So I was definitely more focused. Also, 25 minutes go by very quick!

**3. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?**
An object is used to store a collection of data. An array can be changed and also stores lists of values. My favorite way to look at it is: An array is just objects with some extra methods.  

**4.For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.**  

  * List of all of the students in class: array, list of names  
  * List of states and their capitals: object, state and capitol is a key val pair    
  * List of things to pack for vacation: array, simple list   
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow: array list of usernames  
  * List of student names and their cohort: object, has key value pairs  
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake : object, it had key val pairs
  * All my favorite restaurants: array, simple list.  

**5. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?**  
Instagram accounts. Showing the username, bio, followers, following.

**5. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?**
