## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?
***
After reading articles on section 1 and practicing it more, i feel more progressive on my workflow, it goes much easier and often breaks gives me more understanding topic and perform on my exercises better.
***

1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?
***
Pomodoro breaks definitely helps focus more on topic and work. I did managed to finish some sections faster than estimated time and have more breaks after. My work looks way clean and easy solving.

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?
***
Object is similar as an Array stores more complex data.
objects also has a key value pairs, by storing a data in objects you can get access to it by using key name and set another value of reassign an object.

Difference between Arrays and Object is, an Array stores list of multiple items in a single value. Objects represent "things" with characteristics "properties" that consist a key value.

1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class
  * An Array, because it is contains list of students, like string.
  * List of states and their capitals
  * Objects because it contains two different data types to be stored.
  * List of things to pack for vacation
  * Probably objects because you gonna need sort it out what items in quantity and names.
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow
  * Arrays because you are listing string of names.
  * List of student names and their cohort
  * Objects because you need to use data types which needs to be stored in it.
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake
  * Objects as well, because you gonna use two data types need to store.
  * All my favorite restaurants
  * Arrays because it is a string.

1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?

#### Slack: Fakhatova

#### Chanels: arrays of channels i am registered

#### Dirrect messages: arrays of names

#### Threads: list of threads on topic

#### Saved items: array of codes

1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?

I feel little confused with object and its properties, but maybe it is because i am keep thinking about them as variables.
