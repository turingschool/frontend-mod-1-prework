## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?
My workflow was much more effective. I took consistent breaks every 25 minutes and then slightly longer breaks every 2 hours. I was more effective while I was working and was able to work more hours total.


1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?
I need to keep reenforcing that step. I was consistent with it until progress slowed and then reflexively I think I stopped writing down step 1 because it showed how little progress was being made. I know that as I build my support system and as I get more comfortable with getting stuck I will keep writing down step 1. When the concepts were easy to consume it definitely increased my focus and I was good at estimating that time. As the concepts got more challenging, it became harder to estimate.

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?
Both objects and arrays are used to store data. Data from an array is accessed by referencing an index number. Data from an object is accessed by referencing the property/key.

1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class
  Array. It would not be useful to create a key for each student and thus an objectâ€™s benefit would not apply.
  * List of states and their capitals
  Object. The property could be the state and the value could be the capital.
  * List of things to pack for vacation
  Array. Again, the property names would not be very useful.
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow
  Array. Just like the list of students in the classroom, simple lists are great with arrays.
  * List of student names and their cohort
  Object. Just like the states and capitals, these two categories would work well in a key value pair.
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake
  Object. Again, these two categories that pair together fit the object format.
  * All my favorite restaurants
  Array. Arrays and simple lists are perfect matches.


1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?
TrainingPeaks.
After I do a workout, the following keys are listed: duration, distance, average speed & calories.
Their corresponding values for my workout this last Tuesday are: 57 minutes, 18.4 miles, 18.8 mph, & 586 calories.

1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?
I look forward to working through a ton more examples. Just thinking of the above example started to clear things up for me. As I mentioned before, I would love to go through the flow of data from object instances into the class and its functions/methods.
