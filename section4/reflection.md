## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?

  * My workflow didn't feel that much different this week.  The only thing that was different was that I had to tell my kids to leave me alone a lot more.  I also had to push off hunger more so than I normally do because I wanted to stick to my schedule.  

1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?

  * My goal was to finish section4.  It took way longer than I expected because the first questions in classProperties.js threw me off for some reason.  I had to do a ton of additional research.  I ended up reading JavaScript-for-kids and that took me down a rabbit hole.  I read 175 pages of it because it was reiterating things we have learned in mod0.  So section4 took a lot longer than I estimated it would.  I did like the Pomodoro technique because I turned my phone on silent and only looked at it on my breaks.  This allowed me to stay more focused than I normally am.  

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?

  * An object is a data type used to group a collection of data.  Objects use curly brackets {}.  Arrays are used to store a list of values.  Arrays use square brackets [].  

1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class - Array (list of values)
  * List of states and their capitals - Object (groups a collection of data)
  * List of things to pack for vacation - Array (list of values)
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow - Array (list of values)
  * List of student names and their cohort - Object (groups a collection of data)
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake - Object (groups a collection of data)
  * All my favorite restaurants - Array (list of values)

1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?

  *The Bet MGM app has to log different keys into your bet.  The include team, amount of money you are betting, type of bet (parlay, choosing winner, total points, etc).  Once you fill out all of the bet requirements, it shows you your bet on the active bets page.  You can have multiple bets going at once that all need to fulfill the bet requirements.  

1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?

  * I am still confused about the `this`.  I will have a better understanding of it as we get further into mod1.  I need to practice a little more, everything is still a little confusing, but the more I practice the more it will make sense.
