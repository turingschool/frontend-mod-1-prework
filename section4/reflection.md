## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?
Due to the weather and family emergencies I was really forced to complete these sections in a much shorter time than is intended. I have noticed in my mod 0 HW and assessment that the Pom technique helped me stay calm and focused.

1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?
See above

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?
Objects are a means to store data, but unlike arrays they can store more than one type of data and can be accessed outside of their index.

1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class - Array, since all values are in one set (the same class) and it's easy to just add or remove one via the index

  * List of states and their capitals - Object, because that's a matching pair of data points

  * List of things to pack for vacation - Array, again it's only one data point and easy to edit.

  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow - Array

  * List of student names and their cohort - Object, two data points

  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake - Object, multiple data points that can be dependent upon one another

  * All my favorite restaurants - Array

1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?

My home page on Letterboxd has films logged, films reviewed, films reviewed this year, people i like, and people who like me as the top header

1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?
This one I feel good about.
