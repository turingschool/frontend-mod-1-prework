## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?

*I really like the Pomodoro technique, I have been using with 25 min and 3 min, followed by the 15-30 min rest time. I just realized how much I can learn if i just take breaks, short ones. I feel i'm more concentrate, and more able to do my tasks with quality in less time.*  

1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?

*Found myself more focus because I'm following a plan, usually i get distracted by small things from daily life. I  have this thing of multitask, what sometimes is not the best. So this technique helped me to be more focused, once I know i will have the time for the distraction soon.*

*I got surprised of how well I can follow my plans, was not expecting to succeed so soon. But also discovery unexpected time adding for some exercises I was not expecting to take so long! Sometimes we just use the experiences we already have to try to estimate the time we will take to learn or do something completely new, but it is better to take a closer look before estimating the time the task will take.*  

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?

*Object is a way to group related data together, or is a way of putting more than one related variables together in a way the computer understands it is related.The variables inside the object can be strings, numbers, boolean and arrays. An Array is only one variable with more than one value, or a collection of related values, and typically they are all of the same data type.*  

1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class
  *For this I would choose an Array because it is only one type of variable with more than one value, or a collection of students in class*
  * List of states and their capitals
  *I would choose Object because it is 2 related variables: It would be 2 arrays, one with the collection of states, and one array with the collection of capitals*
  * List of things to pack for vacation
  *I would store this as an Array, because it is only one list, or one collection*
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow
  *I would store this as an Array, because it is only one list of names I follow.*
  * List of student names and their cohort
  *as Object in a class, because it has 2 lists related, one array with the collection of names and one with a collection of cohort*
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake
  *I would store as an object with lists of ingredients, and another list with the quantities in the same order, probably would do an object class*
  * All my favorite restaurants
  *Array as a string collection or one list with all my favorite restaurants*

1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?
*Instagram has StateProperties, with keywords like : constructor, var, this, new,  with the posts, photos, comments, likes, number of posts, number of followers, following, etc.*

1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?

*I still don't understand Methods very well, i found the answers but it did not click yet, and definitely don't know the this keyword.*
