## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?
+ I felt like I was dedicating more solid blocks of work, and therefor more blocks of time for other things. This seemed easier for me to work with than the piecemeal style I was using early on. It made me a bit more focused in the work at hand too. I would leave my phone on the other side of the room and was fine knowing that I could check it every 25 minutes on one of the breaks.

1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?
+ As I mentioned above, I was more focused on the task at hand. My time estimates have (so far) been about right, if not a tad more than I actually needed. I would rather have it that way than the other. The one thing I noticed is that I felt like I didn't want to take my break if I was on a roll. I would push a little past the hard cutoff time, but made sure that I would just _put a period at the end of the sentence_, and not _move on to the next paragraph_ so-to-speak before I took my break.

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?
+ An object stores data like an array, but is not limited to storing that data as an index like an array does. You can use strings to retrieve data from an object. This seems like it would make it a bit more useful and flexible in javascript. You can store the same type of data that you would store in an array, including numbers, strings, booleans, and arrays. You can also store methods/functions in an object that make it like it's own _mini program_.

1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class: Array- We really only need one layer of data, in this case a string with their names.

  * List of states and their capitals: Object- Object- We would want to use a key-value pair to hold the data of "the capital".

  * List of things to pack for vacation: Array- This is just a simple list. We do not need to know the info about each item.

  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow: Array- Again, just a list of account names. We don't need extra info about each account.

  * List of student names and their cohort: Object- Each student needs the data of their cohort stored which we can do with key-value pairs.

  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake: Object- The amount of each ingredient would need to be stored to each individual ingredient.

  * All my favorite restaurants: Array- This is just a list of things. If you wanted to store your favorite entres for each restaurant then you would want to make it an object.

1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?
+ I use a site called Reverb to buy and sell musical instruments. When you sell an instrument it (the transaction i suppose) could become an object and it will log whether or not the item has been paid for, if the item is cleared for shipment, what the tracking info is for said shipment, a 0-5 star rating for the transaction, as well as feedback notes from the purchaser.

1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?
+ Can you create the same method inside both a class and a corresponding object? Will the method interfere with itself? Or is this a non-issue because if we are creating a class, we won't be constructing an object, just filling in the object properties? I'm still wrapping my brain around this, so my apologies if this doesn't make sense.
