## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?

I was able to work through the sections faster than I did on previous weeks because I sat down and was focused on working for 25 minutes at a time. At first the breaks got on my nerves but now I am liking them, and I feel like I'm able to focus on working for longer periods of time that I was able to before.

2. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?

I did not estimate my times correctly at all. Based on how the previous weeks went I overestimated how long this section would take me by a full day. I think that when I was working on sections previously I was not focused on getting the work done, but setting a timer and getting focused on working really helped me stay motivated to keep going and relax when it was time to do that. So far I am really liking the Pomodoro technique.

3. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?

An object is a database for storing and organizing data. The data is stored as properties, which are key/value pairs. An array is a list of items. An object is a list of items that describe or are related to one specific thing, and an array can be a list of completely unrelated items.

4. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class - Array, just a list of names

  * List of states and their capitals - Object, a list of name/value pairs

  * List of things to pack for vacation - Array, a list of different things

  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow - Array, a list of names

  * List of student names and their cohort - Object, a list of name and value pairs

  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake - Object, all of these items relate to and make up the cake

  * All my favorite restaurants - Array, just a list of names

5. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?

Amazon.com - example of an object would be an individual item listed for sale.

Keys include -
list price ($59.99), Amazon price ($35.99), Amount saved ($24.00), shipping price (FREE), arrival date (next day), availability (in stock).

6. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?

Seeing a lot of "classes in JS are bad" on the internet, what's up with that?
