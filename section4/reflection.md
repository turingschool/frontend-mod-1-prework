## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?
- **Felt great! I unintentionally/informally do Pomodoro with frequent breaks as I originally thought it had to do with my learning style. But having more formal rules + set times made it all flow a lot easier. Guess I'll be investing in a physical timer!**

1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?
- **I think overall I felt more focused and less distracted, although I did still have several minorly distracting moments. My sense of time was totally out the window though. I think I might be starting to experience coding "flow" a little bit. (is there a word for the opposite of flow when you're feeling stuck during coding?)**

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?
- **Objects allow programmers to store data with more specific parameters. An array has an ordered list of data with set index positions (0, 1, 2, etc). An object instead lets you access positions with specific strings. Objects seem to allow for more "database-y" type storing.**

1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class **Array as the students should be set/rarely change**
  * List of states and their capitals **Array for the same reason**
  * List of things to pack for vacation **Array as you can still add or remove things to pack**
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow **Object as this list will update whenever you follow a new account**
  * List of student names and their cohort **Object as there are several cohorts that will update over time**
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake **An object could probably easily allow one to double/triple recipe portions here**
  * All my favorite restaurants **Array as you can add or remove and shouldn't update constantly**

1. In this section, we talked about a `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties a bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?
- **I'll use the example for Discord again. Similarly to tweets, users can make comments or posts within specific channels on a server. It probably uses an object for each comment, using keys like username(ex:"MinecraftLuvr33"), body(ex: the message itself), time of posting(ex:3:30pm), reacts/emojis and respective amount of each(ex:ü¶Äü¶©ü¶úüëç).**

1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?
- **None at this time!**
