## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique? 

It was a bit erratic when committing to a 25 minute block but when focused I don't like to have an end time so I realize that possibly each 25 minute block needs it's own consideration of accomplishments desired. I found it more difficult to start and difficult to stop.  However, the work itself was very enjoyable. 

1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?

This was made easy by the instructors because they provided the outline for the work.  I feel that this process may be more challenging when a clear picture of a goal will be necessary in a project requiring skills that have been developed.  I found myself having the same amount of focus during the timing but a nervousness about committing to the time slot that affected my worktime as I considered making prepoarations for a session. This I consider an unnecessary distraction as I began to collect items I might need that were deemed unnecessary (a warm cup, an abundance of water, phone, extra writing utensils and scrap paper etc.).

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?

An object is a class that has a state(properties) in a group much like an array that contains a list of data.  However an object instance of a class has an argument that will modify a method. If a car was being produced in the factory, an object would be 'car', an oject instance would be a particular car and an array would be the list of colors available for paint.

1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class
  
  Array: The student index number and name changes would be updated but there need be no methods to expose the class list to.
  
  * List of states and their capitals
  
  Array: The capitals of states stay the same and state names do not change. The output does not need to be returned modified. 
  
  * List of things to pack for vacation
  
  Object! This will change per vacation in a unique way.  Because setting may equal upscale, different items of clothing are preferred.  If weather equals sunny,   we need the bathing suit.  This I would create an object for.
  
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow
  
  Array: This list may have appendages and possible deletions but I do not see a need to functionally modify parts of this list. 
  
  
 * List of student names and their cohort

If cohort index number and names do not need functions performed on them this must be an array.  Going with an array only if  Array.prototype.includes() really can search for students and cohorts. It seems that this search method could be a function in a loop updating on each pass the class array number. 
  
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake
  
  This may be good to have as an object, as the ingredients could change given the person may not have an igredient or they are baking at high altitude so there is a potential for recipe modification.
  
  * All my favorite restaurants
  Array: This list may change but the restaurant names stay the same.

1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values? 

Dropbox: Stores files in an interactive and user managable database.
keys: Some object properties may include: 
   deleteFileLocal = false, createFolderShared = true, makeFileNote = false, getFileName = "Pinata", filesInFolder = 13

1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?
When do variables usually get declared? I know I will understand this later but if a method or function does not return variables created within I wonder how to navigate this later.  Just jump up above or down below outside your oject I suppose. If I call an boolean method toggling true or false upon a constructor of an object that has this property, does it remain(store) the value in the object for future use or do I need to toggle back manually for the next object instance of it's class to be manipulated? Just a thought. But this is all sort of a new world of thinking. Thanks for your part in opening my mind up to this kind of organization.
