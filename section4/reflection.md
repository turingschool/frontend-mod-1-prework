## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?

I have been using the Pomodoro plugin for chrome since the beginning. I was admittedly cocky initially in thinking that I could manage my own time. I was wrong. My workflow with it has produced higher quality output, keept my brain from shutting down & just staring at the screen, and allowed me to take walks, play a game, & "get out the wiggles" with my daughter.

1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?

My intentions were to be disciplined enough to actually use it consistently, and I have done so with great results. I am still surprised that the focus time always feels shorter than the break time. It is almost ALWAYS the opposite, and I am taking this as a sign that I really enjoy this work.I sing the praises of Pomodoro.

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?

An object is a JS data type "container" for holding properties and type, and can be created using object literal or using constructor function. In JS, an object stores data as a distinct key and is an unordered list, while an array is an ordered list. The two are indexed differently and (usually?) have distinct uses suited for each.

1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class
  Array, because the student list are all the same data type, order matters, and it is easier to edit.
  * List of states and their capitals
  Object, because each state is an entity with named properties
  * List of things to pack for vacation
  Object, because the list is an entity with multiple named properties that you would be able to modify. Different sock types, number of socks, the red cooler...etc
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow
  List, because the names are of all one data type and modifying is easier.
  * List of student names and their cohort
  This one has me on the fence, but I'd go with array because you could make the key "cohort" and the values are the student names.
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake
  Object, because ingredients is a single property with multiple named properties of differing value and data type.
  * All my favorite restaurants
  List, because restaurant names are a single data type. No need for an object.

1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties   an <-TYPO   bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?

The Official Geocaching app. Keys may include:
userName = 'wilTheFinder';
isLoggedIn = true;
numOfCachesFound = 34;
nameOfLastCacheFound = 'Fox in the Henhouse'
gpsCoordinates = '41°24'12.2"N, 2°10'26.5"E';


1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?
How do you format GPS coordinates? I set the value above to a string because it's nowhere near an integer or float with all of the other notation. I found a code format tool online, but I am not able to make it play nice.

Finished!
