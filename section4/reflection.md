## Section 4 Reflection

*1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?*

I like to break my work into sections rather than time. Before the tomato came into my life, my goal was to break down each section into its parts, then work through a single part before taking a break. Some of these took longer than others, of course, so there were a few parts that were split up with a break in the middle. I was also stopping for a quick break before completing the exercises, which gave my brain some time to process before working on the code challenges.

After starting to use the timer, I notice that the time seems to go quickly, but I also feel more frustrated if the timer goes off and I'm in the middle of something, or haven't been able to successfully complete a portion of the code. I think I like the timer, but also kind of don't, if that makes any sense. The urge to push the timer back and back and back is present, and it's difficult to allow myself to take a break when I don't feel like I "deserve" it.

*1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?*

I think I was most surprised that my time estimates were actually a little high. This exercise seems to have helped me focus just on one thing. I tend to think that if everything isn't perfect then the whole thing is wrong, so the idea of breaking things into small chunks actually seems to have cleared my head a little bit, so that I'm not thinking about the end goal or everything that has to happen before I get to the end of the next thing.

*1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?*

An object is like a database. It stores key-value pairs specific to that object. The key-value pairs describe different qualities of the object. If a tree is an object, the key-values could be things like leafShape=triangle, or seasonInBloom=spring.

An array is more like a collection. It can contain varying types of data, and doesn't necessarily describe something specifically.

*1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.*

  * List of all of the students in class
    array - this contains a list of multiple like items [Jim, Nichele, Julia, Matt, Steve]. This could also be contained within an object, say "mod02010a"

  * List of states and their capitals
    object - this would include key-value pairs, eg. Colorado:Denver, Nebraska:Lincoln, Washington:Olympia

  * List of things to pack for vacation
    array - this is a list of things which will go into the suitcase ["bikini", "beach towel", "sunscreen"]

  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow
    object - this can contain various key-value pairs, like userName:xx, name:xxx,

  * List of student names and their cohort
    object - this contains key-value pairs of studentName:cohort

  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake
    object - this contains key-value pairs of amountNeeded:ingredient

  * All my favorite restaurants
    array - this is a list of like items, restaurants ["Yolanda's", "Hacienda Colorado"...]

*1. In this section, we talked about a `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties a bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?*

In the Photos app on the iPhone, there are many folders. Each of these folders could be an object. For example, the object Albums holds the key-value pairs Albums:myAlbums, Albums:SharedAlbums, Albums:PeopleAndPlaces

*1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?*

What is an instantiated object? Is it an object which has already been defined?
