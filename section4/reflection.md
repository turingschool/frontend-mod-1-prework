## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?

I felt like I was interrupted a lot. I would be so focused it was surprising when the timer went off. It took a second to get back into the swings of things after taking a short break to step away from my computer.

1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?

I was off on how much time it took me to complete tasks due to unforeseen hurdles that would come up while working, like if I got stuck on something. I also felt a little distracted by the timer, and felt a little pressed for time to try and complete as much of the task in the time I gave myself to complete it in.

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?

An object is a way to store more complex information. It is different than an array in that, while an array stores ordered lists of information, an object is more flexible and allows the used of strings to store information with the use of key-value pairs.

1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class
  ..* An array would work for the list since it is an ordered list.
  * List of states and their capitals
  ..* An array would work for the list since it is an ordered list.
  * List of things to pack for vacation
  ..* An array would work for the list since it is an ordered list.
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow
  ..* An array would work for the list since it is an ordered list.
  * List of student names and their cohort
  ..* An object would work better for this list because the information is more dynamic and needs more organization.
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake
  ..* An object would be best for this list since there is a lot of information you need to organize and keep track of to avoid mixing up what amounts go with what ingredients.
  * All my favorite restaurants
  ..* An array would work for the list since it is an ordered list.

1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?

Amazon's order history. You might see a key for previous purchases, purchase made within a certain timeframe (within 30 days, 6 months, 1 year), with values to organize which purchases fall into each timeframe. Maybe device information connected to your Amazon account, with keys being device types and values being whether they are connected to the account or not. 

1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?
Is there a limit to how many methods you can have connected to an object?
