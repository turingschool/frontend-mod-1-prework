## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?
I had been doing a version of Pomodoro through this week, which was different, but somewhat useful. For section 4 I tried a more strict version of Pomodoro, and it felt extremely different. I do like the setting a focused goal in mind for how much you're going to get done in the 25 minutes. I feel like that helps with the growth mindset.

1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?
I found that when I was working during the 25 minutes on I was able to get more than I expected done. It may be the mindfulness and use of breaks, but I believe it makes me more focused.
1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?
An object is a way to hold, and call upon multiple points of data. The data in an object can be stored in pair, and can also be accessed through strings.
1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class

  * List of states and their capitals
  Object. Key pairs work well for paired data.
  * List of things to pack for vacation
  Array. This would be a collection of single points of data.
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow
  Array. This would be a collection of unpaired points of data
  * List of student names and their cohort
  Object. Student and cohort could be a key-pair
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake
  Object. Ingredients and the amounts pair together
  * All my favorite restaurants
  Array. These are points of data, not in pairs

1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?
On github the commits are probably objects. It might look something like
```javascript
author: "Marceline"
timeStamp: "20:36 01/14/21"
commitMessage: "Initial commit"
```

1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?
