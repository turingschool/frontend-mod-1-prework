## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?
- I felt nervous and hesitant but excited to get started.
1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?
- I felt more appreciated of the breaks.
1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?
- Arrays have a similar topic. Objects have their own part of a thing.
1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class
  - An array, we were all just in class together
  * List of states and their capitals
  - An object sorted state to capital
  * List of things to pack for vacation
  -An object sort by event
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow
  - An array since there is no pattern
  * List of student names and their cohort
  An object cohort and list of students in that cohort
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake
  - An object, amount of ingredient and then the ingredients in the serving.
  * All my favorite restaurants
  - An object sorted by cuisine

1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?
- Google maps. Routes to options, mode of transportation to bus or rail or self drive, and destination either grocery or gas station or restaurants.
1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?
