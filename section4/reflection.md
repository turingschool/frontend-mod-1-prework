## Section 4 Reflection

### 1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?
+ At times I found the Pomodoro technique to interrupt my flow. I would be in the zone then get distracted by the timer. It was helpful when I had a long work day though.

### 2. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?
+ I found myself well focused when I wrote out my tasks beforehand. When I would get frustrated and/or
lost down a Google hole, it was a good reminder to come back to the task at hand.

### 3. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?
+ An object is a way to store complex data to reference to later. It is similar to an Array
in that we are able to store multiple data types in one grouping. The difference is that data is stored
using key-value pairs within the object to access data through strings rather than indexes. We are able to store unique characteristics of an object through properties that can be updated if needed.

### 4. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class
    + Array: This is a list without unique characteristics.
  * List of states and their capitals
    + Object: Allows us to list the states and apply their unique properties (capitals).
  * List of things to pack for vacation
    + Array: List without unique characteristics.
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow
    + Array: List without unique characteristics.
  * List of student names and their cohort
    + Object: Each student has a unique cohort that may or may not change. We can access
    the changes more easily through objects.
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake
    + Object: We can list the Ingredients and add the property of the amounts needed.
  * All my favorite restaurants
    + Array: List without unique characteristics. If we were going to add reasons why we like
    the restaurants, I would store them in an object.

### 5. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties a bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?
+ App: Co-Star (astrology app)
  + Object: Daily update
  + Keys: Date, username, weather, city, greeting, daily mantra
  + Values:
    + Date: "6/12/2021";
    + username: "It's Gabby, bitch";
    + weather: "80 degrees and sunny";
    + city: Denver
    + daily mantra: "Get rid of the past for something new to begin.";

### 6. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?
+ How do you store a loop function that increases an integer in an object?
+ How do you add new key value pairs?
