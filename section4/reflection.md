## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?
* The Pomodoro technique helps **immensely** when I stick to it! Absolutely will be purchasing a kitchen timer to help with reminders to get up and take a quick break.
* I also did much better with planning my work. I broke section 4 up into bite sized chunks and tackled them one at a time.

2. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?
* Absolutely my time estimations were off! Haha, I struggled a lot more than I thought I would and was having a hard time reaching out for help because I felt I have been asking for help more than others! Lesson learned though, can't ever ask too many questions! Because when I did ask, I got help and understood the exercises and code a lot better.

3. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?
* An array is basically a list that stores other variable. An object is a representation of a physical *thing* that communicates to the computer all the data in the object goes to that one specific thing. Objects are kind of like the computers eyes, enabling it to see an object and determine that it's an object versus just pieces of data.

4. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class
  -- This is a list of people, so an array would be best.
  * List of states and their capitals
  -- Again, this is a list. We are not talking about one physical object. I would use an array.
  * List of things to pack for vacation
  -- Another list! That indicates array.
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow
  -- Hmm.. I think this would be an array? It's a list of accounts, not tying back to an actual object..
  * List of student names and their cohort
  -- I think this would also be an array! It's a list, kind of like attendance. Doesn't directly feed to a physical object.
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake
  -- Object! You are putting together data for a specific object, cake.
  * All my favorite restaurants
  -- Again, I think this is just a list so an array is best here, though it may be an array within an object.

5. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties a bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?
* My user profile is likely stored as an object in Instagram! It may have keys such as name, pronouns, handle, bio. Example values: name: "Anna", pronouns: "she/her", handle: "annnuuuh", bio: "" (my bio is blank, I think.)

6. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?
I am now infinitely curious about Objects. I have questions around the dynamic nature of it and how users interact with objects. I am also super curious about layering in other languages because when I was googlin', I saw a lot of html so I'm just curious and excited to see it all start coming together!
