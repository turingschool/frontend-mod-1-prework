## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?

- [x] How did my workflow feel for section #4? **_I did not use the time aspect of the Pomodoro method. I have a workflow process that I've developed over the years to hit deadlines, and I thoroughly work that process. For Turing section 4 specifically, I (a) review the material from top to bottom, (b) write down in both a note pad and google sheet the agenda and key deliverables, (c) take a break, (d) complete the first couple steps which includes getting aligned around the readings, part a, terminology and reflections and (e) take another break, (f) review the sections I've completed, (g) work through each section until complete taking breaks and reviewing/retracing material as necessary._**

**_I understand the challenge you are putting forth in this section. I've worked with development teams for a number of years, and I realize how difficult it is for these teams to estimate timeframes... and in many instances it seems impossible. I know this will be a challenge particulary on more complicated coding challenges not to mention on teams and with individuals that work at a different cadence or have various skill set levels._**

1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?

- [x] How did Step 1 go? Was I more focused et al? **_I don't mean to undermine this exercise, but I don't have an issue focusing when necessary. I do appreciate the exposure to the Pomodoro technique as I might find it useful in the future either for myself or for others struggling to manage time, stay focused on the task at hand, or hitting deadlines._**

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?

- [x] What is an object? **_An object stores complex data simlar to a database. In a database there is a column header say for cityName then each row contains a cityName such as Boulder or Austin or Chicago. In an object the column name is referred to as the key and the cityName is referred to as the value. These form a key value pair. You can have multiple keys along the lines of cityName, state, zipCode, streetAddress and each of these keys has a value. An example is a simple objected called "address" the key value pairs might be cityName = "Boulder", state = "Colorado", zipCode = "80301"._**
- [x] How is an object different than an array? **_An array is different than an object because an array holds a series of values that are retrieved using the index number while an object contains one or more key value pairs. The key names provides an index or name and the value is the elements as in an array._**

1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class **_I would use an array because it's a single list._**
  * List of states and their capitals **_I would use an object named stateFacts with a key value pair of "state: [array of states]" and "capital: [array of capitals]". This also allows me to add additional stateFacts like the state bird or population and so on. Since the order of the elements in each key value pair array is important, I might develop an ordering scheme. If an ordering scheme isn't obvious, I could always list each sThe alternative would be to have an individual object literal for each state within the stateFacts object._**  
  * List of things to pack for vacation **_I could do either an array or object. If I want to keep it simple, I would use an array because it's a single list. In a more complicated version, I could create an object that establishes a key for specific vacation activites and the items need to pack or for specific people. As an example for the object, I could establish keys based on the packing needs for the camping portion of the trip or the beach or the car or the dog or medication and so on._**
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow **_I would use an array because it's a single list._**
  * List of student names and their cohort **_I could do either as noted for prior examples, but I'd likely use an object because I anticipate there will be other key value pairs that I'll want to assign to each student like pronouns, age, status of some sort, gender, age and so on._**
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake **_I would use an object because the ingredients is a perfect setup for a key and the amount of each ingredient is a perfect setup for a value._**
  * All my favorite restaurants **_I would use an array because it's a single list._**

1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?

- [x] Think of an object in a web app that you use frequently. What is it and what keys might be on it? What are example values? **_I frequently log into my amazon account. The object in this instance would be user with keys that include userName, userPassword, isLoggedIn with related values userName = "Steve Calla", userPassword = encryptedPlease, isLoggedIn = false._**

1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?

- [x] Additional questions. **_None at this time._**
