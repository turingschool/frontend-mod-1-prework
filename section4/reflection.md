## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?

**I have been following the Pom Technique since the beginning of mod0 and I find it super helpful! I wish I had known about prior to now because it really does help me focus. I sometimes have a hard time taking the breaks but when I don't is when I tend to get frustrated with my progress or lack thereof.**


1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?

**I kept forgetting to set an intention each time but every time I completed a pom cycle, I was surprised how much more productive I am using this method. I got the extension mentioned in class and have also been using it for my non-class work to get other things in life/current job accomplished.**

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?

***Object:represent something specific (a "thing") and are a "collection" of data with values vs a single value***

***Array: a type of variable that encapsulates a type of data that can be manipulated, but can also store a single list of values***


1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class ***array: because this is a list of a single type of data***
  * List of states and their capitals ***object: because it is a type of data with a collection of it's key-value pair***
  * List of things to pack for vacation ***array: because this is a list of a single type of data***
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow ***array: because this is a list of a single type of data***
  * List of student names and their cohort ***object: because it is a type of data and the collection of it's key-value pair***
  * List of things to pack for vacation ***array: because this is a list of a single type of data***
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake ***object: because it is a type of data and the key-value pair of each item on the ingredients list***
  * List of things to pack for vacation ***array: because this is a list of a single type of data***
  * All my favorite restaurants ***array: because this is a list of a single type of data***

1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?

**Using school databases, there is a whole search engine devoted to a basic search versus an advanced search. I think some of the example values would be: search, results, return, additional information. For example: search for computers: results: macbooks, pc, windows.**

1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?

***I think less of a question but a reflection, I need to study this section again before MOD1 starts to stay fresh on all of the vocabulary and understanding what it means/does.***
