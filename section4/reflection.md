## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?

Even though I had difficulties actually following the timing of the Pom method and would run through my breaks and vice versa, it was still a helpful tool. I found that I gave myself more permission to take some time and step away from the work as needed.

1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?

I did find that I could often be more distracted than I realized. However, it helped me come back to my work remembering that I had set a timer to keep me accountable.

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?
An object is is another way to store various pieces of information, though slightly differently than the way an array stores it. An array will typically store information that is based on the same or similar data point (animals, foods, books, etc), but an object will take the next step of storing related, but different data points (person's name, age, weight, etc).

1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class
  This would be an array because it only asks for one data point, the name of the students.
  * List of states and their capitals
  This could be an array if they are displayed as one string ("Baton Rouge, Louisiana").
  It could be an object if they're expected to be listed separately.
  * List of things to pack for vacation
  This is an array since it's a list, and it could just be strings.
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow
  This is an array since it's just a list of accounts followed.
  * List of student names and their cohort
  This would be an object since the name would be one list, and the cohort would be another.
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake
  This would be an object since they're different data points, but related.
  * All my favorite restaurants
  This would be an array since it's just a list.

1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?

Another example of a similar web application would be Amazon. Every purchase/shopping cart created will have an object with data about the items in the cart, their cost, the balance, names, etc. 

1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?

I could not figure out how to make the `addTopping` method work in the classMethods exercise. Instead of adding the topping, it replaced it completely. I will need to investigate this further.
