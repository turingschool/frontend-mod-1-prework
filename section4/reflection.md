## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?
  .+ Using the pomodoro technique makes me feel more productive. 

1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?
  .+ I didn't follow it as well as I would of have liked too.
  .+ I feel like I was able to get things done close to what I estimated.

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?
  .+ An Object stores data about "something" in your code. That something is can be complex and the data about it can be changed. Objects are better used to represent a "thing" like a dog in code. Arrays are better used to store a list of things like names of fruit or a to do list.  

1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class
  .+ Array - It is only asking for the name of the students in the class no other information
  * List of states and their capitals
  .+ Object - This is asking for 2 things that need to be kept together.
  * List of things to pack for vacation
  .+ Array - A basic list of items that doesn't have other information about the specfic item that needs to stay with it. 
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow
  .+ Array - It is only asking for the names of the instagram accounts no other information that needs to be orginzied with the names. 
  * List of student names and their cohort
  .+ Object - The names of the students need to be orgizned with the cohort they are in.
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake
  .+ Object - The ingredient names need to stay orginzed with the ammount.
  * All my favorite restaurants
  .+ Array - List of items that doesn't have other information that needs to be orginzed with it. 

1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values? 

.+ A Youtube Account - It might have keys and values like 
```javascript
Account Name: 'Rat Man';
Subscribers: 100;
isLoggedIn: true;
```
1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?

I do not belive I have any questions about classes or objects at this time.
