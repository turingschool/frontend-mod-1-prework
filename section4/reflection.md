## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?

   * My workflow feels like it can continue for a longer period of time than it did previously. I am still experimenting with the lengths of the work time because sometimes 25 minutes feels like too short of a work period, but overall it feels like I can work for more hours with frequent short breaks. Sometimes the 25 minute work period has been better for me as I have felt incentivized to accomplish more in that short period of time.


1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?

    * It seemed like overall I was underestimating how long it was going to take to finish something. I have tried to keep this in mind as I have set intentions for future pomodoro sessions: always giving myself more time than I think. I have used the Pomodoro technique before especially in the past when working on big projects like writing essays. I had not done the intention setting part of the technique, so that has been interesting to play around with. Again, I think sometimes I need more than 25 minutes for some tasks. When I get into a flow state I don't want to cut that prematurely.


1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?

   * An Object contains a collection of data like an Array does. Unlike an Array, an Object does not contain an ordered list of data. Data in objects is retrieved by referencing strings called "keys" instead of the index numbers of Arrays.


1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class:
     * _An array because there is no other information needed to accompany the elements of the list (students)._


  * List of states and their capitals:
    * _An object would work well with this data because it would allow you to pair the capitals with their respective states_


  * List of things to pack for vacation:
    * _An array is fine since you don't need any further information for each thing you are bringing other than its name_


  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow:
    * _An array since this list would only contain names_


  * List of student names and their cohort:
    * _An object is better since you are pairing pieces of data together: student names and their cohort._


  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake":
    * _An object since you are pairing the ingredient name with the amount needed of that ingredient_


  * All my favorite restaurants:
    * _An array since no other data will be paired with the restaurant name_


1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties a bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?

  * An Object that would be displayed to a user in a web application I use would be the news articles displayed on the homepage of a news organization. It is a block on a webpage that includes basic information about the article and a link to a page that contains the full article.
  * Some keys on the `newsArticlePreview object` would be title, subtitle, picture, caption, category, links to related articles, and author.
  * Some sample values could be:
    * title: "Mardi Gras In New Orleans Is All About House Floats"
    * category: "The Cornoavirus Crisis"
    * author: "WWNO"


1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?
  * None!
