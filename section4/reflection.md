## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?

_I find the technique very helpful for retention and my general well-being/work-life balance. I tried applying the technique to earlier sections and had difficult time remembering to turn it on. I decided to pin the extension to to help me remember and I look forward to making it a habit._

1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?

_Setting S.M.A.R.T. goals here is something I'm focusing on and is a work in process. I sometimes need to set goals for the breaks as I try to cram in a number of off-screen tasks into them. Practicing Pomodoro illuminates how distracted get in both focus and break times (with both work and non-work things)._

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?

_Objects group together variables and functions to create a model of something. The elements in an object are key/value pairs and accessible by the key string, not indexed like arrays._

2. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class
    - _Array, because the list is one category with each item standalone (could be 1 column in a table)._
  * List of states and their capitals
    - _Object, because the list is has a value (capitals) for each item (key - states) in the list (could be 2 columns in a table)._
  * List of things to pack for vacation
    - _Array, because the items of the list can standalone without additional data attached to each item._
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow
    - _Array, because the accounts you follow each only have one Name value._  
  * List of student names and their cohort
    - _Object, because each student (key) may have a value (cohort) unique to them._  
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake
    - _Object, because each ingredient (key) will have unique measurement (value) in regard to the recipe._  
  * All my favorite restaurants
    - _Array, because the list is just the names of the restaurant and no other data is necessary._

3. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?

_An item for purchase on amazon.com can be stored as an Object. Some keys for this object could be `name`, `price`, `rating`, and `description`; with values like `E-Kettle`, `99.95`, `4 stars`, `A great item!`._

4. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?

_Is there a way to log a specific object property for each array element without looping?_
_I was unable to figure out how to use apply() in an attempt to add multiple elements to a nested array. How can this be done?_
