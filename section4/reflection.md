## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?

  It's been amazing, following the steps I can stay focus and I can be effective at accomplishing the goals I stablished at the beginning of each block of work. It's an amazing technique to stay on track and focus during a long day of work.

2. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?

  It was good at the beginning, I was able to stay focus and estimate the time accurately, and I was able to stay focused taking 5 minutes breaks and every 4 pomodoros 30 minutes breaks. It was until I got to the classMethod and the tweet exercises that I was not accurate anymore with time, and took me a lot more than planed, still with enough time before the deadline.

3. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?

  An object is a way to store complex data, it's a representation of real life objects or phenomena into mathematical equations.
  And object is more complex than an Array, because an object can perform functions, methods, contain arrays, and we can use it to create different objects.
  An object is used to represent a thing with properties, while the array is used to store a list of related items on a single variable.

4. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class

    Array, because the type of data is related to one thing and it doesn't have more properties to add, just strings.

  * List of states and their capitals

    Object, here the best option would be an object because each state (key), needs to have a capital (value) assigned to it. This way we can access, iterate and do anything with our object.

  * List of things to pack for vacation

    Array, here we have a simple list of items that we can store on a variable and access each item, add, remove or iterate through it.

  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow

    Array, here we can have a list of the names of the instagram accounts I follow, we don't need to add any value to each account name.

  * List of student names and their cohort

    Array, we can store it in an array, inside a string. I think this one would be the best to store it because is a list of things that are related. It would be useful to do it on an object because there is not enough complexity or properties to define.

  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake

    Object, here the object would be more appropriate because every ingredient has a value that is the amount of the recipe, and can be used to describe de preparation process, to adapt the recipe for bigger quantities an so on.

  * All my favorite restaurants

    Array, here I would do it on an array because is a list of things that are related, and we are not modeling and object with many different properties, but this could be the case, depending on the application we are building, for example for OpenTable I would expect every restaurant to be an object, where the properties could be type, price, ratings, etc.

5. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?

  Lately I've been getting rid of things I don't use and I've using ebay a lot, so this comes to my mind very easily, I think of a product I post as an object, where some examples of keys and values could be:
            tittleOfPost: 'Awesome leather jacket',
            price: 300,
            description: 'Amazing motorcycle leather jacket',
            color: 'Black',
            size: 'M',
            style: 'Motorcycle',
            brand: 'Revi't',

6. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?

  This class was the more complex in this pre-work, but after working through the last two excersices I was able to understand and utilize the concepts on a successful way thanks to Priya's help.
