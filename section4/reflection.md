## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?

  - I started using the Pomodoro technique a couple weeks ago. It has been incredible. The more I use it, the better i am able to define how long my work sessions vs break sessions need to be. The biggest realization I have had using the technique has been the awareness of the passage of time, and how long I spend working on a particular problem or project.

2. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?

  - See above answer. Time management is essential!

3. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?

  - An object represents a thing in javascript with unordered key value pairs.
  - An array represents an ordered list or collection of information that can be accessed by index numbers.

4. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class

    - Array. It's a list of names without any specific attributes.

  * List of states and their capitals

    - Object. Each state has it's own key value pair

  * List of things to pack for vacation

    - Array. It's just one vacation, assigned to one list.

  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow

    - Array. It's just one list of things you follow, like the names above, or items for a vacation.

  * List of student names and their cohort

    - Object. Each name has its own key value pair.

  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake

    - Object. There are multiple key value pairs for the one object, cake.

  * All my favorite restaurants

    - Array. It's a list! However, if you wanted to rate them on specific characteristics, then maybe a _class_ restaurants,
      with _object instances_ of restaurant names and the different criteria they are rated on, i.e. service, food, atmosphere etc...

5. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?

    - OpenTable. The object instance might be a restaurant, with a key value pair of price,
      and the argument assigned to the price (price: $$$$ or $$$ or $$). Same for its (rating: 1-5 stars).


6. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?

    - I struggled with how to use methods with classes and the _flow of data_ diagrams would have been a HUGE help for me,
      and probably more examples. I definitely understand why we were being challenged,
      but I still need a better understanding of how to tie all the concepts we learned together!
