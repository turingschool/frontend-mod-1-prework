## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?
  *Work flow felt way more productive and it was easier for me to basically dumb down on what I needed to learn or work on in order to progress to another task.  It helped me stay focused as it catered to my "to-do" list and I realized it helped me help prioritize the rest of my day. Something I want to incorporate into this technique is to also make time specifically for asking questions and engaging with others.*

1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?
  *I did find myself more focused and it did let me tweak out the next steps of after that and what needed to be done. I do need to work on the time I give myself with the tasks, probably gotta give myself more time.*

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?
  *An Object is a way to store more data than an array.  Arrays stores more of an ordered list of data while an Object can use a Strings that can have more information and value to it.*
1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class
    *array*
  * List of states and their capitals
    *object*
  * List of things to pack for vacation
    *array*
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow
    *array*
  * List of student names and their cohort
    *object*
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake
    *array*
  * All my favorite restaurants
    *array*

1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?

  *I could see Facebook using these methods of information on a certain post. Keys that might be on it would be something like if its a photo or video,  numberOfLikes, numberOfComments, numberOfViews.*

1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?
  *I have a bunch questions related to the classes in regards calling methods and how/where to add loops into the coding.  I think that will just take me a little trial and error and practice though.*
