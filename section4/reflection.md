## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?
* It was different. It was hard to get used to it because I've never had a studying technique. and having somewhat of rules or guidelines to follow in studying was hard put into practice.

1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?
* it was hard for me to put it to practice. Because whenever I've studied I've never had to write down a list of what i want accomplished. I had a mental list of what i needed to complete but actually writing it down gives a bit of a pressure to try and complete the task. It was hard to set the timer correctly as I've always just studied until i get stuck and don't let my brain rest, i feel that when i'm in the zone i like to stay in the zone and taking breaks makes me forget what i'm doing or why i'm doing it. So when i had to take break once my timer ran out I would sometimes work through the break timer cause i didn't want to lose my place and understanding of the work being done.

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?
Objects represent “things” (person, car, book) basically anything that is made up of characteristics/properties, that have key values.
while arrays create and store lists of data in a single variable

1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class
    an array would be better like because we can store names in a single variable.

  * List of states and their capitals
    an array when we want a simple list.

  * List of things to pack for vacation
    an array because its a check marked list for organization

  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow
    and object because each account has properties that have key values assigned to them.

  * List of student names and their cohort
    an object

  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake
    and object

  * All my favorite restaurants
    an array would work better because its a list and don't need key values

1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?
  Faceebook
  create post object
  this.content = content (pictures/ text)
  this.time = time (time is was posted)
  this.date = date (date it was posted)
  this.comments = comments (comments left on post)


1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?
* honestly I don't really understand objects. can't we do the same thing with arrays? they can both store different datatypes as well. I'm going to review these exercises and watch a lot more videos to understand better.
