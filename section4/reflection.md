## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?

  I tried my best to follow it, even using the Marinara extension on Chrome. It worked 50% of the time for me. Often I would find myself getting in a grind of typing something out, then taking a break would get me out of the groove. I think it is beneficial for situations where you can't figure out something. In instances where you are having problems with understanding something, moving to something else to distract you temporarily would be beneficial. In my case most of this content has been pretty understandable, or even the research has been highly engaging for me. I want to get better at following this routine not for my productivity sake, but mainly my backs health.

1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?

  Personally as I mentioned above, when I am focused on something I like to stay focused on it. I think setting longer breaks might be beneficial for me. Using the Marinara extension I had the focus timer set to 30 minutes. I think in the future, I would like to try longer sessions of focus and maybe longer breaks. 

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?

  An object is similar to an array in the sense that it stores data. The key difference of an object is it can be used to store a collection of data including arrays inside of them. If an array is a box of things then an object is a box that fits multiple boxes of things.

1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class
      Array
        Array seems best fit due to the nature of a list, it won't change often.
  * List of states and their capitals
      Object
        It would be nice to have a list of states with a different option to see capitals. 
  * List of things to pack for vacation
      Object
        A list of things to pack might be categorized or changed often.
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow
      Array
        Just a simple list, although it updates often, would be easy to use .push method
  * List of student names and their cohort
      Object
        two things to describe, array only allows for one string at a time, "2107" aside "Nate Sheridan" is better than "Nate Sheridan, 2107"
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake
      Object
        Listing out amounts of ingredients as a number rather than a string next to an ingredient is preferred
  * All my favorite restaurants
      Array
        An object might work here if you wanted to add things like address or genre of food, but if it's just a list an array is more than enough.

1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values? 
  I figure an app like Amazon must use objects, setting a blueprint for making their app look universal throughout the page would be a must. It would be easy enough to set an object for all projects with a class. The object may have key pairs as following: itemID, itemName, itemPicURL, itemPrice, itemHasPrime, itemEstDelivery.

1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?
  I had to watch a couple videos to understand classes (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug4ChzopcE4&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9i5yvDkJgt60vNVWffpblB7&index=4), but after watching through that playlist, I think I understand them enough. Once again I need to focus on terminology in order to better follow videos like that and instructions. But after playing around with my code it all worked great.
