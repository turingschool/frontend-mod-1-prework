## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?

The workflow felt intense but focused, which I feel ultimately made me more productive. I tend to forget to take breaks, but knowing I had breaks coming up helped me increase my focus during the 25 minute time blocks.

1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?

I found myself getting distracted looking at the timer and then I would remember that it is only a short 25 minutes and then I get a short break. That helped me increase my focus. I played around with different times as well, and felt a little bit longer worked better for me.

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?

An Object is similar to an array in that it can store data, but allows to store more complex data. An array only stores an ordered list of data in an index, where an object can utilize strings to store more complex data.

1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class: An array would work in that only names would need to be stored. An index would be sufficient for this.
  * List of states and their capitals: An object would allow for key value pairs.
  * List of things to pack for vacation: An array would work for a list of items
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow: An array would work for this list as only names would be needed
  * List of student names and their cohort: An object would allow for key value pairs to store this more complex data.
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake: An object would allow for key value pairs to store this more complex data.
  * All my favorite restaurants: An array would be sufficient in storing these names. However, if you wanted more info about them (maybe address, type of food, prices, etc.) an object would allow to store this more complex data.

1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values? 

Another Object in a web application could be a Health app. It may have a health info object with with keys of weight, height, daily steps with values such as the specific values of these keys in pounds, inches, or steps.

1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?

I would like to become better at naming classes and Objects. Knowing how to be descriptive enough but not too lengthy.
