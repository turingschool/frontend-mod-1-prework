## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?
- The Pomodoro Technique was useful because it made me think about and articulate the specific task(s) to be finished.  Going through the exercise .js files and estimating how much time it would take me to finish the tasks was helpful as well.  Another thing that was useful was the Pomodoro website that I used told me when I would be done with all of the tasks.

1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?
- I'm usually off on my time estimates.  Sometimes, I underestimate the time, sometimes I overestimate.  Sometimes, I went back to adjusted the tasks that I had to do (either break it down further, or go up one level).

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?
An object are _things_ that are defined by specific properties.  Arrays are technically data types (lists) that do not necessarily describe a specific instance or _thing_.

1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class - array
  * List of states and their capitals - each state could be an object, with their capitals as a property.
  * List of things to pack for vacation - array.  I just need a simple list to check off.
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow - array.  Again, I just need a simple list.  If I needed to store other data, an object would be better.
  * List of student names and their cohort - Object.  - Since each instance has additional data to be stored.
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake - Object.  Each cake could be an object with each ingredient and amount of each ingredient as a property.
  * All my favorite restaurants - array.  Just a simple list.

1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?
I use the application "Happy Cow" to find vegetarian-friendly restaurants.
The Object would be each individual restaurant listing.  
Keys include: Name (Sprouts Farmers Market, Urban Burma), distanceInMiles (0.27 mi, 0.61 mi), numberofStars (4, 4), numberOfRatings (1, 8), isItOpen (true, true)

1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?
- Why do we have to put parentheses after calling the method?
  - Is it a function?
  - How do you change a name of an instance of an object?
  - How do I display the items in an array after adding to it with a function?
