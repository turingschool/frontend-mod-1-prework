## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?

*Using the Pomodoro method definitely helped me focus*

1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?

*I normally write down my goals and tasks that I need to perform to help me stay on track. I liked the Pomodoro method because it forced myself to take a break. Normally I will work until the task is completed without any breaks.*

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?

*An object can store data. It can contain many values. It has properties and methods. An Array stores lists of multiple items into a single variable that can be accessed by numbers or the index. An object is a thing that stores lots of data.*

1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class
  *An array because it is a simple list and does not require storing more data*
  * List of states and their capitals
  *An object because capitals is a property*
  * List of things to pack for vacation
  *An array because it is a list of items that can be listed numerically*
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow
  *An array because it is a list of items*
  * List of student names and their cohort
  *An object because their cohort is a property*
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake
  *An object because the amount of each ingredient is a property*
  * All my favorite restaurants
  *An array because it is a list, and no properties*

1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?

*The Rover app there is the sitter object. This contains many properties: name, address, availability, experience. I am actually a sitter so an example for me would be:*
`name: "Sydney Bear"
address: "1560 Boulder St"
availability: "M-F"
experience: 26`

1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?
*Can you use loops with objects and methods?*
