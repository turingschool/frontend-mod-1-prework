## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?
My workflow didn't feel much different because I take breaks around an hour mark of working anyways. I didn't follow the Pomodoro technique all the way, but I did try to keep a track of how long I have been working and if its been an hour plus or minus I take a break and step away from my computer.

1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?
I think it went well since I was trying to be more intentional of how long I had been sitting at the computer and when I needed to give myself a break. It wasn't to different from what I had been doing previously but I was more deliberate about it. I am definitely more focused when I give myself 5-10 minute break sessions. It helps clear the head, but allows you not to get to distracted doing something else and having a hard time coming back to working again.

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?
An object can be anything. You can store the data in an object as strings and instead of using the index position you can use the string value to call a certain part of the object. Objects have key value pairs whereas arrays do not. Array is a list of related items. When calling a specific part of the array, you will use the index position of said array.

1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class: an array because its an ordered list of related items
  * List of states and their capitals: an object because I can use the states and their capitals as key-value pairs.
  * List of things to pack for vacation: an array because its an ordered list of related items
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow: an object because it would make use of key-value pairs for each different type of account that is followed and there could be many different types of accounts.
  * List of student names and their cohort: an object student names and their cohorts sounds like a perfect key-value pair
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake: an object since it could be a bit disorganized and using many different parts of a key-value pair
  * All my favorite restaurants: an array orderly, related list of restaurants

1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?
A website used to purchase items like Amazon. An example of a key would be "Today's deals" and the values would be the list of items that were in that category. A different key would be "Lightning deals" and the values would be the list of items that were in that category.

1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?
For clarification purposes, the constructor is listing out the attributes that each instance listed has in that class. Each method listed in the class changes the attributes to be whatever change we are making to it.
