## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?

My workflow felt really different this week. I don't normally set formal times to do tasks. I also usually time my breaks to be just whenever I finish a task so the breaks could come in 20 minutes or in an hour. I think that a mix of Pomodoro and my own schedule, like more small bathroom breaks in the morning hours (coffee!) and the tasks list written out on post its then removed/thrown away (instead of just a check on paper) as completed could be more effective for my workflow. I also did NOT like the noise of the ticking of the counter as I found it very distracting and anxiety producing so I will not be using it again.  

1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?

Setting the intention/goal of each day then ordering the tasks and doing them one by one made me feel more accomplished. I did feel like I was making progress throughout the day. I was more motivated by seeing the tasks list shrink too. I was however seriously off on my time estimates for completing tasks. I think a big part of this was because some concepts I understood more easily and could complete with minimal problems but other concepts just didn't click in my head very easily so I spent WAY more time on some tasks then I allotted.  

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?

An Object is a data type that is used to organize related data with key-value pairs together. Objects are different from an Array because Arrays are a variable that stores a list of values numerically. Objects can store Arrays within but Arrays cannot store Objects.

1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class - *Array because students in a class are a simple collection of related things.*
  * List of states and their capitals - *Object because the states are a collection of things but then each state has a value*
  * *assigned to them so we need to use a key-value pair.*  
  * List of things to pack for vacation - *Array because it is a simple collection/list of like types of data(things).*
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow - *Array because it's a collection of one person's accounts.*
  * List of student names and their cohort - *Object because the student names are the key and the cohort is the value*
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake - *Object because each ingredient is the key and the value*
  * *is the amount needed. Is is organized as a pair this way.*
  * All my favorite restaurants - *Array bacause it is a collection of related items that is indexed numerically.*

1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?

Amazon.com would have a class *OrderHistory* and then the keys could be customer, order, timeStamp, and quanity. The values could be "Samantha", "macBookPro", "12:12pm", 1.  

1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?

 Is there a way to account for a user trying to call an Object but using a different nomenclature such as writing the word "fifty" instead of the number 50 or vice versa? I could see this coming up with some words too, such color/colour.
