## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?

I use the pomodoro technique on a regular basis, but recently I've switched from sticking strictly to 25-minute pomodoros to a more flexible approach. When the timer goes off after 25 minutes, I set it to five minutes within which I start my five-minute break at some point. This gives me up to five minutes to find a good stopping point.

1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?

It went well. Setting an intention for the pomodoro and writing it down helps me focus and improves my time estimates for tasks. It also preserves a record that I can look back at and analyze to tweak my study habits.

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?

An object comprises key-value pairs called properties, which can store all data types, as well as functions in the form of methods. Whereas an array is an ordered list, an object is an unordered list that isn't beholden to a strict numerical order.

1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class: Array, because it's a simple list of names (strings) without the need for additional properties.
  * List of states and their capitals: Array, because it's a simple list strings of states and capitals (e.g., 'Pennsylvania - Harrisburg') without the need for additional properties.
  * List of things to pack for vacation: Object, because the keys can be the items and the values the quantities of each item. This format will allow for easy transformation of quantities without affecting the associated keys.
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow: Array, because it's a simple list of usernames (strings).
  * List of student names and their cohort: Object, because the keys can represent the student names and the values represent the cohort, allowing for easy changing of cohort if the student repeats.
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake: Object, because the ingredient would be the key and the amount the value. Order doesn't matter as much because that will be outlined in the recipe instructions.
  * All my favorite restaurants: Array, because it's a simple list of names (strings).

1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?

Amazon.com probably uses an object to represent each item in the shopping cart, including keys and values such as `quantity: 2` and  `shippingSpeed: 'Next-day'`

1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?

How does nesting work?
