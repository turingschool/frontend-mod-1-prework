## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?

    - I really enjoyed the Pomodoro technique. I feel like it helped me work for longer and be more focused. I did find myself ignoring the breaks after trying it for several days. But, it eventually reminded me to take a small break and get back to work. It also helped me keep track of what I could accomplish in a certain amount of time.

1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?

    - Overall, it took me a little bit longer to get my tasks done than what I would set aside for. But, I found myself very focused because I knew exactly what I wanted to accomplish.

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?

    - An object is a type of data that holds key-value pairs (variables/characteristics of the object).
    - An array is a collection of items that are related/associated to each other, but they don't all belong to the same item. An object is a "thing" and all key-value pairs encompass what the object is.

1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class: array
  * List of states and their capitals: object
  * List of things to pack for vacation: array
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow: array
  * List of student names and their cohort: object
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake: object
  * All my favorite restaurants: array

    - I chose array for those sets of data that are lists or collections of items, which don't have other characteristics associated to them. And, I chose object for those collection of items that have other characteristics associated to each item. For example, I chose an array for students in a class because it is a list of student names and doesn't include characteristics of the students other than names. But, I chose object for the student names and their cohort because it student will have their name and their cohort characteristics which would act like key-value pairs.

1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?

    - For the Google Calendar web application, they probably use objects for each Event in the calendar. The events might include the following key-value pairs:
        - title: "Mod 1 Orientation"
        - date: "Jun 16, 2021"
        - time: "9am - 12pm"
        - location: "Zoom link"
        - description: "Cohort 2107 Orientation"
        - guests: ["student 1", "student2", "student3", "student4"]

1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?

    - I am curious about the application of these concepts once we have the user interacting with them.
    - In an object, how do you prompt the user to insert the argument for each state?
    - How would the actual counter for the number of likes look like for an instagram post or similar objects?
    - Since there are multiple ways to code for the same thing, for example, use the push() method instead of concat() method, how do we know what is best practice?
