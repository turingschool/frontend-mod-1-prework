## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?
- :/

1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?
- Find myself more distracted.

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?
- An object can be anything you define. An array is a preset type of data, ie ordered list.

1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class
  - Array. It's a list of just names.
  * List of states and their capitals
  - Object. States and their capitals better come in pair.
  * List of things to pack for vacation
  - Array. Just a list of random things.
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow
  - Object. These accounts may contain a lot info such as profile pic, name, topic, number of followers.
  * List of student names and their cohort
  - Object. Students and their cohort better come in pair.
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake
  - Object. Same reason as above.
  * All my favorite restaurants
  - Array. restaurant names are enough.

1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?
- Email. Each email has a title, sender address, time, content, and sometimes attachment. For example, sender may be Turing, Title is "Tuition reminder", time is July 4th, 2020, content contains a link.

1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?
- If I declare an array parameter in the class constructor,say testArray, then I create a method to add one element to the array using testArray.push. Why does the terminal say "testArray is not defined"
