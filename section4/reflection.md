## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?
-This is a technique I often follow. I work best in small chunks with rewards of short breaks.
I tend to work best in 1-2 hour increments (with small breaks within that time). It allows me time to defrag my brain and not overload it with too much information.

1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?
An object is like a database for storing and organizing data. An array stores data using index positions.

1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class
  Array- Pretty simple data that can be stored as an ordered list.

  * List of states and their capitals
  Object- This can be more dynamic as an object. We can create a state and capitol that is stored as a series of strings.

  * List of things to pack for vacation
  Array- I'm a light packer and this can be stored as a simple list of contents

  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow
  Object- A variety of data can be stored in relationship to each of the accounts followed such as the account name, number of followers, images shared, likes for each image, and comments

  * List of student names and their cohort
  Array- The variable could be set to a keyword that matched the cohort that then logged the array of names as a string

  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake
  object- An object can be created for a cake with strings of ingredients and their amounts set

  * All my favorite restaurants
  Array- this is a simple list to manipulate
  Object- If I wanted to be more complex about the types of restaurants I am favoring (Mexican restaurants, burger restaurants, expensive restaurants, etc), then I would store this as an object with the added data

1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?
* Flight Purchase Object
Potential keys could be:
-departure city
-arrival city
-layovers
-date
-time
-price
 Different behaviors may be:
 -baggage fee adds to price
 -seat selection fee adds to priceInDollars
 -You would want to send confirmation of Purchase
 -you could add a cancel flight and a reschedule flight option


1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?
I'm anxious to learn how to create classes and objects that take user inputs.
