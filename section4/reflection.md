## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?
- I actually was much more efficient and took way less time to complete certain tasks when I set time limits and followed the general guideline of the Pomodoro technique. Admittedly, I'm still working full time during Mod 0 and prework, so I'm operating on a "get as much done as you can" schedule, but I tried my best to follow the Pomodoro technique and it was super helpful in keeping me focused.

1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?
- It went well! I was truly surprised that having a simple intention "Get through the vocabulary of section 4" in the first 25 minutes allowed me to be laser focused. Whatever "distractions" came up, I pushed aside for a moment and got to them on my 5 minute break. I accomplished way  more in shorter times when using the Pomodoro technique.

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?
An object is a way to store complex data in JavaScript. It's different from an array, because arrays list things in order, and in order to access them, you have to call on the *index* to get each piece of data stored in the array. With objects, you can use the dot notation to access whichever piece of data you want.

1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class
  - Array. It's a simple list, and would be easy to access by using the index.
  * List of states and their capitals
  - Object. Being able to find the state by it's name rather than index position would be helpful. We don't know if they're listed in order or not!!
  * List of things to pack for vacation
  - Array. Not enough pertinent information in my opinion to need an object.
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow
  - Object. This information changes. Sometimes we add people we follow, sometimes we take away from it. It's more complex and I think an object would be best.
  * List of student names and their cohort
  - I think an object would work here! If you wanted to know what cohort someone is in, you could access that info with their name, or vice versa.
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake
  - Object! Would be much easier to find ingredient amounts if you were able to just look it up by the ingredient.
  * All my favorite restaurants
  Array. A simple list of restaurants with no other data to store could be organzied simply in an array.

1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?
- I feel like I use this reference a lot, but I think a clothing item listed on a website would be a good example. The object could be `Shirt` for example, and could have keys like `name, color, size, price` etc. Example values would be `"short sleeve", "red", "small", "$10.99"`.

1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?
- I have questions about the proper syntax in certain situations. I felt like I knew the `.push()` method was the solution to one of my last problems, but it took me a long time to figure out how the correct syntax for this specific situation. Also, in the `classProperties.js` assignment, I could only use each class one time. So every time it asked me to make a new `Dog` class, I came up with a new name for it. Not sure if I misunderstood something, so my apologies if so!! Often times there are several solutions to a problem, and I want to find the way to not overcomplicate a code block for a potential coworker who has to go back in and read that code or edit that code. I really enjoyed this section though, been my favorite so far!
