## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?
  * Okay, it's hard to get into the habit. I did order a timer though to help me stay
  on track with the Pom technique. I had a lot of challenges with git pushes to GH which
  were excessively time consuming. After I got that sorted everything else was far less
  time consuming.

2. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?
  * I took timed breaks. Found myself feeling more rushed, slightly focused but also distracted by the time. I was way of on time estimations as the last two exercises had a lot of complexities I had not practiced yet.

3. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?
  * An object stores dataTypes, like an array, but provides more organization options
  than an array.

4. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class
    - Array. The only dataType is student names, there are no other data values to store.
  * List of states and their capitals
    - Object. Since there are two dataTypes an object would give cleaner code and a more
    organized log - state as key, and capital as value.
  * List of things to pack for vacation
    - Object. Since there are multiple dataTypes an object would organize them best.
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow
    - Array. Again, this is only one dataType so it could be an Array of Instagram accounts held in strings.
  * List of student names and their cohort
    - Array. The variable would be cohort, and names could be an array.
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake
    - Object. There are multiple dataTypes, as each ingredient could be it's own key,
    with the quantities as the value.
  * All my favorite restaurants
    - Array. Unless the restaurants are organized by a genre or type of food, I would keep the list in an array as they're all one dataType.

5. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?
  * I do curbside grocery pickup with my local grocery store. The object class would be GroceryCart, with keys including item, quantity, and price. The item values would be the grocery items, the quantity would be how many of each item, and the price would be the price per item.

6. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?
  * Still feeling insecure about adding number values to existing object instances.
