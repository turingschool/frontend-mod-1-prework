## Section 4 Reflection

#### 1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?

- Since I got in to the 2010 cohort off of the waitlist, I've been doing all of this pre-work in one fell swoop, so I haven't exactly had a week to try out Pomodoro. For the short duration of my experiment, my work felt intensity felt about the same, but I felt less drained at the end of it.

#### 1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?

- I found that my time estimates were pretty inconsistent. Often times I worked much faster than estimated, and then occasionally, one problem would take me much longer than I thought.
- I focus very intensely while I'm coding: it's easy to get tunnel vision and avoid procrastinating. So, I'm not sure yet whether the pomodoro helped with focus or more with mental health.
- I find it a little bit redundant to declare an intention when the work I'm doing is already highly regimented (as in this pre-work). I think the intention method will become extremely useful when I am working on more nebulous projects for which I have to determine my own workflow.

#### 1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?

An object can stores information in pairs (keys paired with values) so that you can access values by referring to their associated key and the object name, instead of relying on their numbered place in an index (like items in arrays).

#### 1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class: array - simple list of items
  * List of states and their capitals: object - need to pair one type of value with another
  * List of things to pack for vacation: array - simple list of items
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow: array - simple list of items
  * List of student names and their cohort: object - need to pair one type of value with another
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake: object - need to pair one type of value with another
  * All my favorite restaurants: array - simple list of items

#### 1. In this section, we talked about a `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?

*Strava*
```
var todaysWorkout = {
  type: run
  averagePace: 8.76
  distanceMiles: 5
  elevationGain: 1600
  maxBPM: 179
};
```


#### 1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?

- Still not sure I fully understand how classes are actually stored and used by the computer. I understand (on a basic level) how to use them as a computer, but not so much what goes on behind the scenes.

- I don't quite get why class methods have to be defined *inside* a class: it seems as though they would work the same way if they were defined outside of a class and then called on objects.
