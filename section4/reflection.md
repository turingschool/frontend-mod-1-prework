## Section 4 Reflection

1. **How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?**

I have been following the Pomodoro technique for most of the Mod 1 Prework, so compared to the other days of doing that it felt similar. Compared to work that I have done in the past, using Pomodoro makes it *much* easier for me to ignore distractions. If I have a passing thought about a task I need to do or something to add to my shopping list, I only have to wait a few minutes until my next break to get to it so I don't have trouble putting it off.

Strangely, I notice that I have a much harder time actually taking my breaks with the Pom technique than I do if I am just working at my own pace. I think that once I switch on the 'productivity' mindset, it can be hard for me to break it. Not to mention, often time pom breaks come when you are in the middle of a problem and it isn't the best time to walk away. I lengthened my work sessions to 35 from the default 25 minutes (as set by the Marinara Chrome extension) and found that worked better for me.

1. **Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?**

I found that I wasn't really breaking my work up into consistent chunks, and I had a hard time estimating how long things would take (in both directions.) A few of my steps took a lot longer than I anticipated, and a few took a lot less time than I thought they would. Usually I set larger objectives for myself (i.e. I'm going to finish section4 and my the GearUp readings today), but I think it is easier for me to not meet the goal when I have such a large objective.

Right now, I don't have much going on other than working on Turing homework, so managing my time I think feels less urgent and it's easy to chunk off a whole day. However, I can see how setting smaller tasks makes more sense in most applications, because usually we are juggling a lot of different deliverables for work plus personal obligations. Breaking off smaller tasks to accomplish during a time frame I think would be really helpful for managing this.

1. **What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?**

An Object is a "thing" represented in your code, that has its own characteristics (properties). Object instances come from a class, and can be used like a database to store data in. An array is a list of items that are values of a variable, and are associated with a numbered position (index). Only an index can be used to access the data in an array, unlike an object which can use strings to access its data. Arrays are ordered, and objects are not.

1. **For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.**

  * List of all of the students in class
   *Array: this is a list of values of the variable student.*
  * List of states and their capitals
   *Object: Each state would be an object instance, and their capital would be a property of each object instance.*
  * List of things to pack for vacation
   *Array: list of items that doesn't include any characteristics of the items.*
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow
   *Array: list of items that doesn't include any additional properties (characteristics) of each item.*
  * List of student names and their cohort
   *Object: you need to store the student name (object instance) and a property of that instance, their cohort.*
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake
   *Object: the amount of each ingredient is a property of the ingredient, and so would be stored as a property of the object instance (ingredient).*
  * All my favorite restaurants
   *Array: this is a list of restaurant names that doesn't include any additional characteristics about the restaurants.*

1. **In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?**

Glassdoor: would have an 'employer object'.
Some keys might be employerRating, numberOfReviews, sharedSalaries, jobs
Example key-value pairs:
employerRating: 4.3,
numberOfReviews: 167,
sharedSalaries: ["$65,400/year", "$125,000/year"],
jobs: ["Marketing Manager", "Junior Developer", "Campaign Manager"]

1. **What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?**

-I read that all data types in Javascript are technically objects. How does this work?
-I'm confused about how objects interact with variables- it seems to me that each property of the object is essentially a variable, but just denoted differently. Are there other differences between properties and variables?
- Despite answering the question above to the best of my ability, I still feel sort of fuzzy on the concept of objects vs arrays, and also how you work with them differently when coding.
