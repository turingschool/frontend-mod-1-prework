## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?

  - The workflow felt good, but very different, with the Pomodoro technique. It forced me to fully read and understand tasks before beginning, because I had to be intentional about planning out my day. I wasn't tempted to check emails as they came in or social media when I was stumped on something, I knew that I'd have a break soon and that I just needed to stay focused until that break. After breaks I came back to my desk to work, I felt refreshed--more awake! Normally, I'd feel guilty taking a break from work...like I needed to be productive every second of the day, which would only cause more fatigue and less excitement about solving the problem at hand while working. Being EXPECTED to take a break and ENCOURAGED is a game changer! Also, the checkmarks really did feel very satisfying!

1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?
  - I did find that my estimates for the time it would take to complete certain tasks were a little all over the map. Some tasks I thought should have taken much more time and others a little less. For instance, setting up calendars (for the first 3 wks of Mod1) always takes me much longer than I expect; however, I think that is because I get really hung up/concerned about chunking out personal study time appropriately. I think this will get easier as I become more familiar with workflows and find commonalities behind assignments. I felt more focused on the task at hand using the Pom technique, I know it's not a race...but in a way I kind of felt hyper-focused because I'd want to get to a really good stopping point before my 25 minutes was up. Kind of fun.

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?
  - An array is an ordered list, which means you can only access items within it by their position. An object can carry more complex data (collection of data) and kind of group them in key/value pairs. Data within an object can be access using dot notation and calling on a key.

1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class
    - Array. There is no indication of data associated with each student that will need to be stored, so an array would suffice.
  * List of states and their capitals
    - Object. If someone wanted to know the state associated with a certain capital city or vice versa they would want to be able to use the dot notation to call upon one of these values.
  * List of things to pack for vacation
    - Array. They are singular items to be packed, no one item is more important than another and there is nothing associated or special about each item that you need to know for the packing process. Adding them into an array would suffice, you don't need to access anything by string.
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow
    - Object. Initially I would say an array would be good for storing this, but to utilize the functionality of the search bar to search for a particular person's account you follow on Instagram it seems like you'd want to be able to search using a string (their name), so I'd say that an object would be better suited.
  * List of student names and their cohort
    - Object. You'd probably want to be able to look up all the students in the same cohort (by sring) or individual students and their respective cohorts.
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake
    - Object. There is a benefit to pairing items here, the ingredient would be the key and the value would be the amount of each ingredient. An array would not allow you to associate these two together, whereas an object does.
  * All my favorite restaurants
    - Array. There is no association that needs to be made for any one restaurant, they are all considered favorites so an array would suffice for storing these names.

1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?
  - I use Strave frequently and they've likely use an Object to represent a logged workout. The keys utilized for each workout would be:
      - Type of workout   
      - Distance (miles)
      - Elevation Gain (ft)
      - Time (hr:min:sec)
  - Values associated with each of the keys above (in corresponding order) could be:
      - Bicycle Ride
      - 4.01
      - 1600
      - 1:38:28

1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?
    - none right now, still digesting classes.
