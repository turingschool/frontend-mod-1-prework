## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?

I don't use the Pom method. I work the best just grinding it out while i'm in the zone

1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?
Objects are data types that can contain many values. It can house functions and classes unlike an array

1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class - Array. Simple list of names 
  * List of states and their capitals - Object. To match the states with the capitals
  * List of things to pack for vacation - Array. Simple list of items needed
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow - Array. Simple list of names
  * List of student names and their cohort - Object. List would need ot match names to cohorts
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake - Object
  * All my favorite restaurants - Array. Simple list of names

1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values? 


1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?


How to make the specific object instance we called on with the method dynamic.
