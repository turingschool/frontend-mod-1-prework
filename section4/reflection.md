## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?
  * It proved to be a bit challenging simply because I deal with a lot of interruptions regularly. With my current pandemic situation, there will be always be interruptions. What I did find helpful was to set a timer to at least have a reminder to get up and stretch or move. Even if I didn't make as much progress on the work in the set amount of time as I would without distractions, I did find taking a quick 2-3 break was refreshing.

2. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?
  * Again, because of distractions, I wasn't as focused as I would have liked to be. This did help me plan more realistic expectations though. I began to adjust my intentions to smaller bits but then have the next intention waiting should I be able to get that in.

3. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?
  * An Object is like a database for storing and organizing data of any data type. An Object and an Array are very similar. They are both mutable and can have different actions performed on them to manipulate their data. It seems that the biggest difference is that an Array is more like an itemized list, while an Object is a more a "thing" with defined (changable) properties for the data.

4. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class
    - Array: just a list, no properties along with them
  * List of states and their capitals
    - Object: could easily be set in a key:value pairing for nice organization
  * List of things to pack for vacation
    - Array: itemized list.
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow
    - Array: itemized list.
  * List of student names and their cohort
    - Object: key:value pairing with student: cohort for organization
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake
    - Object: key being the ingredients and the amount of each being the value.
  * All my favorite restaurants
    - Array: itemized list of restaurants.

5. In this section, we talked about a `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties a bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?

  * Any trip planning website would have this. Sadly, I don't currently use those frequently at the moment. Let's say Expedia. Key and value examples would be:
    - departureDate : '4/4/21',
    - returnDate: '4/11/21',
    - numberOfPassengers: 3,
    - carRental: false,
    - hotelRoom: true,

6. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?
  * Is there a particular reason that classes use PascalCase?
