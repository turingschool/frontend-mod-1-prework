## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?

My work flow this week went smoothly. I installed the Pomodoro extension for Chrome which
I like a lot better than the application I was originally using. I like how it interrupts
or _breaks_ the screen each time a chunk of focus time has been completed. Before, I was
only getting sound alerts which I missed numerous times.

2. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?

My first time using a Pom application, I was overworking through the focus time and missing
short breaks. Over the last week, I've used the Chrome extension which has worked a lot better. I found that it was easier to focus on my intentions and found myself being less
tired throughout the day and evening hours.

3. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?

An object is a way to store a collection of data while an array is an ordered list that can be search and sorted by index number. An object uses strings as properties and logs the value of each property in what's called a key-value pair. This allows you to use the object like its a database for storing and organizing the information. An array can be a value in a key-value pair of an object, which is why objects are more complex.

4. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class - An array will do the trick, as it's just an ordered list of data that can be sorted and accessed by its index number.

  * List of states and their capitals - I'd use an object called state with two key-value pairs; one for name and one for capital.

  * List of things to pack for vacation - An array because it is an ordered list and that can be sorted and searched

  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow - I'd use an array accountsFollowing that will hold each account name that I'm following.

  * List of student names and their cohort -  A student object with key-value pairs for name and cohort.

  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake - An object with key-value pairs for each ingredient (key) and amount (value) pair.

  * All my favorite restaurants - I would use favRestaurants array, a single variable can hold the array of favorite restaurant names.

5. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties a bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?

```
### wikipedia.org            Object: city
    *keys*                   *values*    
    name (string)            "Dunhuang"
    province (string)        "Gansu"
    population (string)      "191,000"
    area (string)            "12,000 sq mi"
    postalCode (integer)     736200
    translation (boolean)    true
```

6. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?
