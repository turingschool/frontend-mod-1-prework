## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
**I definitely have room for improvement in all areas, but the two that stood out to me for big improvement are reading and taking care of my brain. I might add something that touches on the importance of empathy, but maybe that already relates to teaching others.**

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
**Number - can be an integer (whole number) or a float (a number with a decimal)**
**String - letters or special characters wrapped in quotes used to represent variables**
**Boolean - states if something is true or false**

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?
```
var greeting = "Hello World!";
console.log(greeting);
```

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?
**Double backslashes //, allows for purposes like taking notes, describing the purpose of a function, leaving comments for other developers to see.**

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
**Variables allow us to store information once declared.**
**ELI5: Variables help us name things and store information.**

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?
**I use Discord for gaming. There are probably different variables for usernames (string), number of users in a server (number), and online status (boolean).**

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
**Concatenation is a fancy programming word for joining things together.**

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?
**If someone updates their status (similar to a tweet/Facebook post), I'm guessing it uses concatenation involving the username, time of posting, and tidbits of other variables.**

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
**Is most JavaScript work typically done thru Atom or different software?**
