## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
> The SuperLearner article link was broken. I found something that might be similar on slack, [here](https://pubs.ppai.org/pc-today/six-habits-of-super-learners/). Of these SuperLearning tips, I do already teach others what I know. I'm a big fan of repeating what I've learned out loud, as showing others how to do something helps me retain it. I should probably take breaks more often. When I get in the zone working on something, I neglect to step away from my work and take a brain break. Something I do that helps me learn is to read out loud, and repeat the read if I'm not comprehending a particular section of the reading.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
> `String` - this is text or characters that belong together, such a sentence or paragraph.
> `Boolean` - is a true or false value.
> `Number/Integer` - is digit numerical value. This can be a whole number, decimal (i.e. a float or period), and is not seperated by commas.

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?
> `console.log("Hello World!");`

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?
> `//` indicate comments in JS. These are used to provide instructions, or additional information or captions that the code writer may want to include about the code they have written for future reference.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
> A variable is anything that can vary. I would tell a 5 year old that a variable is anything around them, noticing that all the things are different. A lamp is a variable. A toy is a different kind of variable. A variable can also be a number. So if they have 5 toys, the 5 could also be the variable. Or a variable could be a true story, or a lie. Such as "I am 5 years old, would be a true variable. And "I am 6 years old" would be a lie, or false variable.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?
> For the Instagram app, three variables that it would use would be username, followers, following.

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
> Concatenation adds or plugs in declared variables into strings.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?
> Thinking about Instagram, if my variables were followers, and following. The declared values for those variables would be numbers. Concatenation could be used to display the followers and following variables with their corresponding numbers.

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
> Why are concatenation and interpolation both used, if they do essentially the same thing? I'd love some examples on when to use one vs. the other, and why.
