## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

The SuperLearner Article made me think more like a developer. I feel that I am already teaching others what I know. When I can, I try and help others out in the Slack channel. I want to read a learn a lot more about coding. I think that collaborating more with others should be added to the list. Working with others may teach you things you don't already know.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

To be honest I started out not knowing any of these data types. This was all new and different to me.

Numbers - This data type includes all numbers, negative numbers and decimal numbers. Decimal numbers are referred to as floating point numbers. They are written without commas.

Strings - This data types consists of letters, numbers, and other characters including emojis. This data type is wrapped within quotations. Quotations can either be single or double but must be same at the beginning and at the end.

Boolean - These data types result in true or false statements.

Array - This data type is written in brackets and holds a list of numbers or strings.


3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

console.log("Hello World!")

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

// This is how you would code comments in JavaScript. Two back slashes.
// Using a comment code helps other developers be more explicit about what they are coding

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
Variables are used to store information that is going to be referenced at a later time. It's like a jar with a label on it and you put something in it to use for later. For example the jar says "Cookies" and inside you put chocolate chip cookies that you are going to eat sometime in the future.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

I frequent the website Facebook often. Some variables they might use would be:
1) Number of friends a person has. They would use the data type numbers.
Example: var friends = 536;
2) Profile nick name. They would use a string data type.
Example: var profileNickName = "Mc Sleazy"
3) They would use an array for names of the person's friends list.
Example: var friendsList = ["Bill Dipperly", "Charlie Sheen", "Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson"]

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
Concatention is putting things together. This could be strings or numbers.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?
I frequent the Colorado Vaccine Finder page. Developers use data across multiple platforms to see what locations have available vaccines for the public.

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
I'm still unsure of when to use a Boolean statement. When would be the right time to use one?
