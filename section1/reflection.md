## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

I already view learning as a process and that it's a journey.  My take on life is that there's always something to learn from new situations and to take challenges as learning opportunities.  So keeping an open mind and enthusiasm to learn new skills was great to learn more about.

I should start reading more often than I've been doing.  

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?
var string = "\`\"Hello World!\"\`";
console.log(string);

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?
// Text after two backslashes

or

/* Text in between asterisks and backslashes */


5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
A variable is a method of assigning and storing data types.  It is like a container that contains information like numbers, letters, words, or a collection of words.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?
Username, Password, Security Answer
Strings

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
Concatenation is a way of joining variables together to be used together.  If different data types need to be modified in a way to work with one another, JavaScript will do it for you (called type coercion).

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?
When prose is personalized to the individual using the site/app

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
- How do existing websites/apps use variables?
- How do they use interpolation/concatenation?
- What are the other data types?  
- What can we use variables before beyond printing them?
