## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? What do you want
to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
~ I resonate most with the growth mindset. I have always valued this outlook very highly.
~ I do most of these things already, to a point, except for taking care of my brain. My diet ain't so
   spectacular, but I'm working on it!
~ I want to do more reading, take better care of my brain, and teach others more often (I don't like to take
   roles that put me in a leadership role, but I recognize the benefits of growing skills/comfort in that area).
~ I would expand on the growth mindset in two areas: firstly, to have a "radical" openness to any and all  
   perspectives (especially those that run contrary to our own beliefs/opinions or just flat-out offend us).
   It is very difficult to have our strongest-held beliefs challenged, but doing so benefits us in so many ways.
   We may learn we were wrong, which benefits us by aligning us with the truth. On the other hand, we may learn
   we were *right*, and now we know *why* we were right all along. Knowing these things enables us to clearly
   articulate our reasons for rejecting certain beliefs/belief systems and with an effectiveness/clarity that
   can potentially convince even our most staunch opponent of the error of their ways. This is because we now
   know why they are incorrect and (perhaps more importantly) *how* they actually arrived at those incorrect
   beliefs (as opposed to how we might *think* they arrived at them).
     Secondly, to foster and grow our own curiosity. It is very difficult to maintain a growth mindset, even
   more difficult to intentionally seek out contrary opinions/beliefs/perspectives to our own, and (most
   difficult of all) to impartially evaluate those contrary perspectives for any truth they may hold (I have
   never found a perspective that was 100% false: in fact, no matter the perspective, each one seems to be
   comprised *mostly* of truth with just a sprinkle of falsehood thrown in...just enough to spoil the whole
   thing, but I have found it is wise not to "throw the baby out with the bathwater" ðŸ˜„) However, maintaining
   an insatiable level of curiosity makes this process much, **much** easier.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
~ I learned about strings (a collection of characters enclosed within quotation marks), booleans (any statement
   that works out to either "true" or "false"), numbers (any integer, floating point, or negative/imaginary
   number), and arrays (list-like object with a searchable index).

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?
~ There are numerous ways of doing so. However, the simplest may be *console.log('Hello World!');*


4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?
~ "//" and `/*
           (Stuff goes here.)
           */`
~ The purpose is to include descriptions and helpful comments pertaining to the code within the code itself, and
   without interfering with the actionable portions of the code.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
~ "A variable is like the word "dog". There are many kinds of dogs, like Golden Retrievers, German Shepherds, and
   Chihuahuas, but they are all called dogs. So, dog is a variable, because it can mean *maaaaaaany* different
   types of dogs! What about the word "cat"? Do you think the word "cat" is a variable? Can the word "cat" mean
   many different kinds of cats? Can you think of another word that is a variable? What about "people"? Are there
   many different kinds of people? Is "car" a variable? Are there many different kinds of cars?"

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?
~ Youtube. It perhaps uses variables like "watchTime", "watched", and "textField", containing numbers, booleans,
   and user-defined strings respectively.

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
~ Concatenation is the function name for combining previously separate strings and numbers into one, single
   string.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?
~ In the comments section of YouTube, after you post a comment, that comment will appear with your username as
   the header. Perhaps some form of concatenation is occurring here.

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
~ My question is, why is "not having a question...not an option"? ðŸ˜œ
~ Ok, fine! I'll ask a *real* question: I'm wondering how these little steps translate to the more complicated
   coding we'll be doing later. Is all coding built on these simple, basic principles, just with ever more complex
   syntax/functions/methods? Or are the foundational principles found in these early lessons just a small sub-set
   of the foundational principles of coding as a whole?
