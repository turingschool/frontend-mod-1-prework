## Section 1 Reflection


### How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

*It was interesting to see how much reading other people do to grow their brain. I've always heard, "read a lot in order to train your brain," but hadn't really seen examples of how much some successful people read. I do like to read and while I'll be doing quite a bit of reading and growing through the Turing program, I want to make time to continue reading about other things that interest me. I already see learning as a process and have worked to develop a growth mindset. I was a teacher for 6 years and have been learning through teaching by virtue of my job for a while, but need to remember to explicitly practice this in a new field. I think it will be really helpful to me to explain concepts I've recently learned to other people. It will take a lot of conscious effort to take care of my brain by eating good food and taking breaks, but that is a big important thing I want to make sure I am doing (I have a tendency to get hyperfocused and forget to eat and rest).*


### What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.


*In this section, I learned about numbers, strings, and booleans. Numbers are a data type that handle all numbers, including negatives and decimals. Strings consist of letters/other characters and are wrapped in quotes. Booleans evaluate whether something is true or false.*

### How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?


*console.log("Hello World!");*


### What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?


*Comments are indicated by // and the purpose of them is to serve as notes for developers in plain language that the computer will ignore and not run as code.*


### In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?


*A variable is information that you want a computer to remember so that it can run a script (or do something you need it to do). It can be something complicated, or something simple, like when someone asks how old you are and you tell them, "5." A computer can do that too, but you have tell it the variable "age" equals 5*


### Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?


*For a lot of sites I use there is a log in screen, which has a place to input your username and password, which would be stored as strings. For online shopping sites you have to enter your credit card information, so these variables would be stored as numbers. For sites that offer online technical support where you begin by talking with a robot and they ask you questions followed by things like, "Enter Y if that's correct," I'm guessing there is variable data stored as booleans.*



### In your own words, explain what concatenation is.


*A concatenation is a combination of strings joined by the operator, +.*



### Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?


*For my previous job, we used iStation frequently and when students log in, it says, "Welcome, [student's name]." I think that the concatenation pulled the variable declaring the particular student's name from some file tied to their log in, so any time a student logs in, it pulls from something like, ("Welcome, " + studentName)*



### What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)


*I feel like I found a way to run a boolean in the variables exercise, but I don't know if it was written with best practice or if there is a standardized way to do it that is better for when code gets more complex than declaring whether or not I am hungry. What are some best practices for when there are multiple ways to code something?*
