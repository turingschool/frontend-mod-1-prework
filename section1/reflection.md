## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
I loved the SuperLearner Article, I feel like I resonate with number 1 the most. I **LOVE** to read, and in my free time you'll usually see me with my Kindle in my hand and noise cancelling headphones in. I also resonate with number 4. If someone has a question and I have an answer I love to help and teach that person everything I can to help them understand the topic.   
I find that I never really take short / often breaks. Once I am in my working mood, its hard for me to stop. But Turing has helped me start to take these short and often breaks, and now I understand why they are so important.  

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.  
**Number:** A number can either be an integer or a float. An integer is a whole number not including a decimal or fraction, it can be negative, positive, or 0. A Float is a number with a decimal point, it can be positive or negative as well.   
**String:** A string is a Data type that consists of characters, special characters, and sometimes numbers as well. The string is wrapped in quotes and thats how it differs from a number.   
**Boolean:**  Boolean is a data type that has two values, true or false. Usually booleans are used in yes or no questions within your coding.   


3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?  
var testString = "Hello World!";  
console.log(testString);   

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?  
//  example of text!! //  
/* example of text!! */  

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?  
Variables are words/labels that are used to represent information.  
For example, you could tell me something along the lines of "I just had a drink!" I would know that you had just drank, but I do not know what your drink was. The meaning of 'drink' can change frequently. This is where a variable could come in handy. Your variable would be drink and what it equals is what you actually had to drink.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?
**Facebook:**  
var online = true; -boolean
var name = "Darla Evans";  -string
var numberOfLikes = 430; -number/integer  

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.  
Concatenation is when you add two things together or when they join together. The operator for a concatenation is + in JavaScript.  
8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?  
I think a lot of things use concatenation. But what stook out to me the most is ADs that pop up on your phone or Emails. Sometimes these emails and ADs will have your name placed in them. For Example: "Hello Darla! Saw you were looking at water bottles! Here's the best one ever, and you should buy it!" The concatenation brief example is  "Statement" + "Name" + "Statement" these can both be variables and then added together it looks like the AD we just read.   

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
I am curious from someone who knows concatenations better what website they first think of that uses them a ton. It was very hard for me to brainstorm an answer.
