## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

I feel as if the article is basically saying that "SuperLearners" are people that are always questioning problems and always trying to expand their knowledge. I personally want to interact with more of my cohort mates so that we can teach each other and in turn that teaches ourselves. Explaining or teaching seems to be one of the most effective ways to retain information that you have learned. I don't think that there is too much more to add, the article was very clear and concise.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

  1. **String** - A string is a data type that can use any characters as long as the line is wrapped in quotations.

  2. **Interger** - An integer is a data type that uses all whole numbers. That means all negative whole numbers too. A **Float** is a data type that is similar to an integer except it uses a decimal point.

  3. **Boolean** - A boolean is a data type that determines if a a value is true or false. True and false cannot be wrapped in quotations as JavaScript will represent it as a string instead.

  4. **Array** - An array is a data type that represents a group of things or values. It can be used to assign related values together.


3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

var welcomeMessage = "Hello World!"
console.log(welcomeMessage);

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

You would use "//" to indicate comments in JavaScript. The reason they are used is to add information for other developers to interpret and understand what you have done to the code. They can also be put in the middle of a line of code to "deactivate" that line of code.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

A variable is essentially used to store a value or information that can be accessed and used in different places.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

I use Instagram a lot and they probably use Integers, Strings, and Arrays. I think that integers hold number values such as Likes, Follows, Direct Messages, etc. Strings hold all the different lines of text that we will see inside the app. Arrays probably hold things such as the followers for your profile.

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

Concatenation is a term to describe combining strings together using a "+".

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?

Concatenation is used on Youtube to search for videos. You can combine words(strings) and/or numbers to create a personalized search for a video.

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)

A question I have is, when to use concatenation over interpolation. It seems as if interpolation is significantly easier to write and read, so I'm having a hard time understanding injection vs combining.
