## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

<<<<<<< HEAD
_The concepts shared here will be especially helpful for ensuring success at Turing, and I am regularly trying to apply these concepts to maintain my health and well-being. I am breaking bad habits with the Pomodoro technique, and I greatly appreciate that Turing prioritizes learning this behavior. I hope to start branching into reading more books, rather than only listening audio books, which I do a great deal of._

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

_I learned about three main data types used in JavaScript: Strings, Numbers, and Booleans._
_A string consists of alphanumerical and/or special characters wrapped in single or double quotes (open/close quotations must be consistent)._
_The number data type includes both floats and integers; positive and negative alike (no commas for big numbers)._
_The boolean data type evaluates one of two values, true or false._

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

`console.log("Hello World!");`

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

_Single line comments start with a double forward slash (//)._
_Multi-line comments start with a slash asterisk (/*) and end with an asterisk slash (*/)_
_Code comments allow developers to include additional information for themselves, others, or use code comments to de-activate sections of code._

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

_A variable is used to tell the computer to remember something (various datatype values), so we can use what was remembered later on (in our codebase)._

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

_I use an app to book reservations at my gym, which is currently operating at lower capacity due to COVID:_
_The various locations for the gym are stored as string data types._
_The spaces available for booking reservations is a number data type._
_The slot availability is a boolean data type and toggles based on the number of spaces available_

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

_Concatenation is the joining of two values together. "Cat" + "Dog" = "CatDog"_

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?

_All ecommerce sites seem to separate the objects that make up your shipping information. However, all the information is concatenated onto a summary, receipt, or invoice when the order is placed._

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)

_Isn't 9 > 12_
_//=> **false**, because 9 is less than 12?_
