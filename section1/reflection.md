## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

   I thought the article was very insightful, and I resonated with the section about polymaths claiming to not have superior natural intelligence and implying that the success of the Leonardo DaVinci's of the world is the result of being a good learner. I liked that they framed it as a skill that can be built on. I think one of the things from the list that I already do is teaching others what I know. I get really excited when I learn new things, and I love to share it with my friends and try to get them on the same page. One thing I definitely don't do enough of is reading. I have a bad habit of starting a book for a month or so, then forgetting about it and not picking another one up for the next 10 months.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

   I learned about **numbers**, **strings**, and **booleans**. Numbers can be either whole integers or floats with decimal points. Numbers can also be manipulated with operators in JavaScript. Strings are for data that contains letters and other characters. Unlike other data types, strings must be surrounded by quotation marks. Booleans are for data that can have a true/false result. Often times a boolean will apply to a question, or a comparison of other data types. I imagine booleans like a light switch in my mind, they can be either on or off (unless you have one of those cool fader lights).

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

   I would write `console.log("Hello World!");` in the terminal.

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

   Sometimes when you're working with other coders, it would be helpful to insert comments about what you coded or why you coded something in a specific way. It's faster than trying to decipher it through the code alone. It's also super easy, in JavaScript you write // and anything after the double brackets on that line will be ignored by the console. You can also write /* and close it out with */ for a multi-line comment.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

   A variable is anything that might change later on, like the shirt you're wearing.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

   On Instagram, three variables could be the username, number of followers, and whether or not one user follows another user. The username variable would be a string, the number of followers would be a number, and whether or not one user follows another user would be a boolean.

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

   Concatenation is the process of combining multiple variables or data types in order to create a new result. JavaScript will even change a number to a string when combined with another string through *type coercion* because it is nice to you.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?

   On the Spotify wrapped feature, Spotify took the variable of my `mostListenedArtist` and used concatenation to combine it like `"In 2020 your the artist you listened to the most was " + mostListenedArtist` which is cool so now I can show it off to my friends on Instagram.

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)

   I was confused with the part in `dataTypes.js` that was asking to use a modulo. I've never heard the term and don't really understand what it does even after looking it up. Also the exercise to `"log the result of the modulo of 10 into 54"`, does that mean `10 % 54` or `54 % 10`?
