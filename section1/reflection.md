## Section 1 Reflection

*1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?*  

The Superlearner article gave me a greater perspective of what it will take to learn at Turing. Having a lifelong learner mindset resonated with me because I consider myself a lifetime student, even if I'm not always in school. I am always pushing myself to learn new things like Business, Real Estate, and Investing and keeping that life long learner mindset will help me immensely at Turing.  Along with having a growth mindset, I already regulate my time on my own with helpful apps like Google Calendar and Pomodoro. Regulating my time is crucial to success and Google Calendar helps me greatly with that. I am also learning to take efficient breaks at the right times with the Pomodoro chrome app. Gearing up for Turing, I want to implement a healthier diet and get more regular exercise. I also want to read different content more often rather than the news. If I am going to strive for a growth mindset throughout Turing, I should strive to read at least one book a month.  

*2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.*

String - A data type consisting of letters and other characters, all wrapped within quotes. Ex: "This data type is a string".   
Number - All numbers, including negatives, and decimals are referred to as floating point numbers. Ex: 7, -7, .07.   
Boolean - A data type that only returns True or False. Ex: 3===6 -> False, 2===2 -> True.    

*3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?*  
```
var hi = "Hello World!"  
console.log(hi).
```

*4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?*  

Double forward slash ex: //.  Or
Forward slash asterisks ex: /* */
Code comments are used to communicate with other developers or used to de-activate code.  
Code comments are also used to example what a certain area of code does. It helps organize our code to make it easier to read and work on.

*5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?*  

A variable is a code used to store bits of information. It holds for information. The computer uses them to remember things more easily.  
Ex:
```
 var quantity = 3;   
```

*6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?*

I use Facebook.  
```
var firstName = "Shawn"; //String.  
var lastName = "McMahon"; //String.  
var Age = "29"; //Number.   
```

*7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.*  

Simply put, it is "joining together". It is the act of combining two or more variables in JavaScript using the '+' operator.   We are able to make strings dynamic with the ability to concatenate different variables together to form different scripts depending on what the situation calls for.
```
var name = Sam;  
console.log = "Hello, my name is " + name);    
//This will output "Hello, my name is Sam"
```   

*8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?*   

I use a site called Twitch frequently. When broadcasters go live, I think the developers likely use concatenation for 'Going Live' notification that is pushed to users. It is probably used like this:     
```
var userName = user;  
var goingLive = " is now live!";
console.log (user + goingLive!);  
//Will log â€œUser is now live!
```

*9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)*

When I run my exercises in the terminal they do not output the changes I have made to my copy of the fork I have made. They only output some of the lines of the original file. I am starting this pre work early before I have Slack access so I am not able to reach out for help quite yet. I will need to follow up with this problem and resolve this since this is essential to the exercise.
