## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

    Many aspects of the SuperLearner article resonated with me was that there was no end cap to learning. I honestly make a realization that I don't want an end cap in any of my attributes such trying to be fit, or be more charismatic. I already read a lot, perhaps not as much non-fiction as I should be reading but a lot none the less. I happy to know that I am 1/6 of the way to becoming a super learning in that regard. I do want to start by sharing, or teaching more. I did not realize how crucial group studying was until I did it for the first time as an adult. You do retain much of that knowledge and you usually know a lot more than you think. I would add writing everything down. It's the same as sharing your knowledge but on a more personal and deeper level. I think it's healthy to record yourself.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

String: a data type made up of characters
Number: Whole integer or floating Number
Boolean: a data type of true or false statements
  true - the data is correct or present
  false - a value is not present or errs towards negative values (0, -0, null, false, NaN, undefined)


3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

console.log("Hello World!")

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

// A way to communicate the way humans speak within the code source with out effecting the code.


5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

A variable stores information such as values or other data.
To 5 year old "A variable is like a bucket. You can put things like your other toys in it and I bet you can name all of them. You can put rocks in it and try to count them. It is also okay to have nothing it too. "

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

Reddit
I imagine that it would host almost all data types but I know it definitely uses strings, numbers and booleans
var numberOfComments = 1,567
var postTitle = "dog eats fish"
var hasRead = "false"

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

Concatention is when you merge two strings together, or a string and numbers into a string.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?

I feel like faceBook. Whenever you create an account it'll ask for your first name and last name but when you log in it show it as your full name.

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
