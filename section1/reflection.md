## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

I think the author did a great job coalescing some relevant ideas. I resonated with the first three points that he made about the way one can approach learning & the mindset of doing so. I love the idea of learning as being a process, and an adaptable mindset being key to it. I have never felt like there is an "end" to learning something. I had a 20 year career and I learned multiple new things nearly everyday. I've felt and experienced the cognitive bias of "The less you know about something, the more that you THINK you know", and at some point realized just how much more there was to learn (Basically, The Dunningâ€“Kruger effect).
The part about teaching rung loud. When I think I have my head wrapped around a relatively complex idea, I often ask someone to let me bounce what I have in my head to them to see if it makes sense. It's not necessarily a teaching experiment, but if i've dug really deep into something like the difference between the Sunni and Shite belief ideas, I retain the material much more clearly.
Brain health is and has been a priority for me for about a decade. My career demanded between 20-120 hours per week, depending on the season and the schedule. Eating bad food, losing any sense of rhythm to sleep, and spending my downtime literally recovering from work were all bad bad bad for me. I started turning down outside jobs, keeping only my primary job and attempting to have something close to a work/life balance. Things got better, but there was only so much that I could do. This is a substantial motivator that pointed me toward Turing. I do not mind hard work, but I have missed too many birthdays, cookouts, parties, holidays, gatherings, etc. to work like I did for another 20 years.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

String: Composed of letters & characters, a string could be a list, sentence, or a combination of types of data.
Integer & Float: whole numbers, and numbers that have a decimal point or negative value, respectively.
Boolean: It it a binary true/false data type.
Array: It is a data structure that represents a group of "things".
Object: Combined with data, it is a working model of an object, like a coffee cup or a human.

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

console.log("Hello World!");

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

//The purpose is to have JS ignore the text, but provide visible annotation when viewed on an editor/console.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

A variable is kind of like a bucket that can hold different values.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

geocaching.com:
var isLoggedIn = true;
var userName = "Frank the Tank";
var cacheViews = 125;

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

It is a method used to join strings to produce a new string that combines the text from two or more strings into one.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?

My Google Home hardware will yell the time at me if I ask it to. The software may use concatenation to output the time, for example, the hour is 8, minute is 23, and second is 24. What I hear may be assembled via concatenation.

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
I am not as comfortable as I'd like to be with pseudocoding. I'm still left looking for a solid resource on the web. I find it difficult to pseudocode without having the full picture of what tools are available to approach the problem. I would be thankful to be pointed towards a good resource (not a question, but still).

I have many questions! I want to know how all of "this" connects. The amount of material is sometimes wildly overwhelming (and a bit scary), but I want to know how these pieces fit in the bigger picture.
