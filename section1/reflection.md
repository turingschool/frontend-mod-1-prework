## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

   * The _SuperLearner_ article for me further emphasized some of the habits I am already, but also introduced someone new ones as well as giving a larger context to why these habits are important. I feel like I already read a lot, have an active growth mindset, and take care of my brain. I am excited to find more opportunities to teach others what I know including my partner as well as taking more breaks. In the past, I have often tried to do too much at once, so I appreciate the reminder of how important it is to give your brain breaks. I also appreciated how the article made these habits relevant to the tech industry's constant change and therefore requirement to learn new things. In the tech world, information is currency, an investment, and is ongoing and self-motivated.

   * Here are some other things I have been working on to improve my learning:

      * I summarize, group, and reuse information so that I do not forget it. Anytime I can find a new useful category of things that I have been learning, I find that I remember those things better. For instance, I have note sections that include JavaScript commands, Keyboard shortcuts for different applications, and processes that I will be using frequently like how to use Git. It is much easier to remember chunks of similar information that to go back through my notes that are just grouped by the date they were written down.

      * I constantly keep track of information or concepts I am struggling to understand. I have a document of all of the things I find challenging, so that I remember to continue to try to understand these ideas.

      * I use pneumonic devices to remember difficult information as well whether that means an acronym, or associating a concept with an image or animation in my mind.


2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

   * I learned about the following data types:

      * **String** which is a data type that stores all kinds of text. String is always wrapped in single or double quotes.
      * **Numbers** which encapsulates the data types of integer and float where integer comprises whole numbers and float includes decimal numbers but not 0. There is no special syntax for Numbers
      * **Boolean** is a data type which always contains the values `true` or `false`. Boolean helps computers to make decisions on which scripts it should run. I also learned about the following comparison operators used for Boolean logic including `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `>=`, `<=`


3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

   * `console.log("Hello World!")`;


4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

   * `//I would use back slashes to indicate comments`
   * The purpose of a code comment is to further explain sections of your code particularly if those sections are complex. Comments are for yourself in the future and for other coders.


5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

   * A variable tells the computer to save memory for different kinds of data to be reused at different points in the code.
   * ELI5: A variable is like a box that holds something else inside it. The box tells you on the front what is inside of it.


6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

   * I use the note taking app Evernote frequently. Here are three variables that are probably used:
      * `userName` variable which holds string data type
      * `noteSize` variable which hold integer data type
      * `noteBookList` variable which holds an array data type


7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

   * Concatenation is a way to combine string data together using the `+` symbol. Here is an example: `"I feel " + "good" + " today!`


8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?

   * I think the welcome pages of websites you use where you are logged in with an account will often save a firstName variable with your name and will concatenate it with a greeting message to read something like `"Welcome back " + userNAme + "!"`

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)

   * None
