## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
*I think all points made are good, the 3 point of regarding growth mindset was one that stuck with me. Although all 6 points are great, the 3rd one is kind of a new concept to me. Thinking about growth in regards to learning isn't new but thinking of it as a big picture in regards to my self worth is something that I'd like to get better at. I also really need to get better at reading and retention of my reading. Most anyone can read through a book, but I think the real skill is retaining and remembering the information that read. Although I agree with it, I do think thinking of information as a currency is a bit out of my scope of thinking. I think maybe I just value my skills less because most of them are obtainable with a couple Google searches, but I figure more people should know they can do that and they don't. I think something that might be good to add is open-mindedness as a whole. Understanding that people think in different ways is vital to being ahead of the crowd of oblivious, and also being a SuperLearner in my mind.*

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

Numbers - *Numbers are datatypes used to store number values, with number values you can use math on the variables.*

Strings - *Strings are datatypes of text that store strings of text like words, symbols, and numbers that are likely to stay constant.*

Booleans - *Booleans are datatypes that answer yes/no questions in true false format, they are used to say on/off yes/no and true/false, among other things as well.*

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

*console.log('Hello world!')*

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

*To start a comment in JavaScript we use '//', these are used to explain what your code is doing in clear English (or other languages). Commenting is helpful for whoever is reading your code to understand what is happening in the code.*

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

*In my own words a variable is a place to store data values, I think a good way to think of it is a container of some sort, whether that be a bucket, a hat, a box, any sort of container works. In this container is a place to put "something" it doesn't matter what you put in the bucket, but its able to hold "something". Then you put your bucket away, but you know because you put "something" in the bucket it will be there still. So when you're looking for "something" you grab the bucket because you know that it contains your "something".*

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

*I am ashamed how much TikTok has taken over my life the past year with the pandemic. Albeit a simple app, functionally, the way it all works has me thinking about how it works on the backend side of it all the time. To my understanding, when you scroll past a video without watching that information is stored, that expresses "Hey this user didn't much like this video, don't give it to others that don't like videos like this". Basically building a tree of data with different sub-categories that build everyone out their own 'For You Page'. This might be a bit too complicated for this assignment and question, but I assume each video is given a couple of variables. I figure they might read out something like this if they were done in JS:*
**
var videoID = 12394892
var videoLikes = 21032
var videoViews = 220320
var userWatching = "natesheridan"
var videoLength = 48
var userWatchtime = 12
etc...
**

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

*Concatenation is adding together different parts of code to create a bigger picture code, I think there is probably a better way to explain this but thats how I think of it my head*

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?

*I'll refrain from using TikTok as an example again to avoid bore, Another website, as of recently, I have been visiting a lot is Google calendar. Though I don't know this for sure, based on my understand thus far this whole page is just running a ton of concatenation. It grabs all my events from a database, and parses them in to a format that is understandable to my brain by putting it all together.*

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)

*I am slightly confused about the use-cases of concatenation vs interpolation, in my head at the core they do nearly the same thing, just grab the data using different symbols. So what is the benefits to using concatenation vs interpolation?*
