## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
  * I currently practice (or try to be aware of) habits 2 and 3 - these are "view learning as a process" and "adopt a growth mindset". Something that'd I'd like to focus more on is habit 4 - "Super learners teach others what they know". As Turing is just as much about learning how to code as it is developing the skills to work within a team, helping others who may be struggling through a scenario or new topic (and receiving help from others) is extremely important. As the article also points out, the ability to walk others through tough concepts is proof that I understand them myself.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
  * String: a data type that represents text - a String can consist of alpha-numeric characters as well as special characters and spaces.
  * Number: a data type that represents each a whole number (Integer) or decimal number (Floating Point or Float).
  * Boolean: a data type that represents either a "yes" (true) or "no" (false) with regards to boolean or conditional logic. These values typically result from a conditional statement.

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?
`console.log('Hello World!');`

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?
  * Single-line: `//`
  * Multi-line: `/* */`

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
  * My words: a variable represents data stored within a computer's memory so as to be accessed within an application or script at a later point in runtime.
  * ELY5: a variable is like a labeled box that has a number or word inside. When needed, we can take this number or word out and use it, or replace it with another number or word.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?
  * YouTube: videoTitle (String), viewCount (Integer), and isVideoPlaying (Boolean).

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
  * Concatenation is the consecutive joining of two String values.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?
  * Sometimes I use Ulta's order ahead and they'll send confirmation emails to notify me when an order is ready. In the greeting of the message, "Hello Jon," will display. "Jon" is more than likely a variable that is concatenated with the "Hello" portion of the greeting.

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
  * In regards to concatenation, is this only relevant to Strings? Or would you consider the value of "5" as the result of "2 + 3" a concatenation of "2" and "3"? (I'm not using quotes to denote a String, just as emphasis)
