## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

I've been working toward viewing learning as a process and adopting a growth mindset, as these run counter to the anti-pattern of perfectionism. I already eat healthily, exercise regularly, sleep well, and use the pomodoro technique to ensure that I take frequent breaks. At Turing, I'd like to make better use of teaching others as a way of solidifying newly acquired knowledge. I'd add spending quality time with friends and family to the list, as social connection consistently ranks at or near the top of factors that promote well-being and happiness, and I assume it supports learning too.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

Strings are one or more characters, usually words, and are indicated by single or double quotes. Numbers are, well, numbers, represented as Arabic numerals. Boolean values are either true or false, and, for example, are used with dichotomous values (e.g., yes or no, black or white, etc.).

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

console.log('Hello World!');

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

Contrary to the what's stated in the README.md for this section, two _forward_ slashes `//`, not backslashes `\\`, are used to indicate comments in JavaScript. Developers use comments to offer human-friendly in-line explanations about something that's going on in the code, without affecting how the code runs. A forward slash and asterisk (`/* example text */`) is used for comments spanning multiple lines.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

A variable is a label for a container, the contents of which may change over time. For example, if I'm moving houses, I would put an 'Anthony's Stuff' label on a box of my belongings. I may use that box multiple times over the course of the move to carry different collections of my stuff, but the label stays the same.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

Google Maps probably uses a string for the address, a boolean for the 'Open Now' filter, and number for the destination's distance from me.

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

Concatenation is combining values together, usually strings, to form a new singular value.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?

When Amazon.com displays a welcome message 'Hi, Anthony', it's probably using concatenation to combine 'Hi, ' with my name.

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)

What are other examples of type coercion that we'll come across as developers?
