## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?


*Although I do several of these already, I think since the pandemic started, I know I've become a less voracious reader and I have had a much harder time retaining information.
*I do love learning and see it as a journey, part of what invigorates me about this career change is that learning will be a continuous process.
*One thing I want to improve upon is implementing the Pom method and make sure I actually take the breaks.
*I know there is much to learn and to retain with only 7 months, I want to help my brain work both its hardest and its best.
*I think another thing is digging more into what it actually means to have a growth mindset. It is a term that gets thrown around in the k-12 world a lot but it is rarely define in practice. It is an aspect of myself as a learner that I want to cultivate and keep growing.


2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.



2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

**The data types from this section are:**
*Numbers: this refers to integers (whole numbers, either positive or minus, large numbers that in the real world would generally have a comma are shown without one in javascript, ex: 1,500 is just 1500) and floaters (the numbers that are not whole, such as 5.45) ``var thisYear = 2021;``
*Strings: this in the text which we assign variables to with which the value is pieces of information, ex: ``var activity = "hiking";``
*Booleans: these are the true or false values that are assigned within the code, ex: ``var = likesHiking = true;``


3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?


``var greeting = "Hello World!"
console.log(greeting)
``

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?


``//`` *This allows the developer to both go in and read notes left my previous coders and see what happened and to make notes of what they are doing. I think of it as the sticky notes left to explain something of a memo.*

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?


**A variable (var) is what we do when we declare what something means. It means we have declared the meaning of that thing it will represent when we write it in code. // For a 5 yo: A variable is what we call var, and we use it to show what something means. For example if your favorite thing to do is blow bubbles, we would type: `` var favoriteActivity = 'blow bubbles outside' ``

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?


*www.alltrails.com: I would imagine that three variables used regularly are strings, numbers, and arrays. I think the strings would hold information describing the trail descriptions, the numbers to describe things like trail length in miles, and the arrays to bring both of those variables together.*

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

**Combining strings together in the console log by using + to create a full sentence and reads as an output to see it as when we are reading uncoded langauge.


8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?

*Returning to alltrails, I would imagine that concatention is used regularly to combine pieces of information from various strings to describe the different hiking trails and aspects about them such as vegetation, trail conditions, and trail length, just to name a few.


9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)

*Which is used more regularly in writing code, concatention or interpolation?
*I've been checking my code I'm writing as I work through out the exercises in the console.log before I run them in the terminal after working in atom. Is that normal practice??
*Why can I run all my js files except for variables through node? This one just will not work.
*Also, is the reflection file misnamed on purpose?
