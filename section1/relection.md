## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

I enjoyed reading the SuperLearner Article I found I do some of the things on the list already like
+ Having a growth mindset
+ Taking care of my brain
+ Teaching others what I know

Some things I would really like to improve on are 
+ Taking short breaks ealry and often 
+ Reading more

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
+ String - Characters that inside of a pair of quotes 
+ Number - A number negitive or positive. They can also include decimals.
+ Boolean - Is data that will evaluate as either true or false


3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?
```javascript
console.log('Hello world');
```
4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

```javascript
//
/*
*/
```

The purpose of a code comment is a way for developers to talk to each other and let each other know what is happening in the code. 

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

A variable is how you keep track of stuff in code. An example of this would be if I had a grocery bag that had milk and choclate in it. We know what is inside the bag. But then I take out the milk now the grocery bag only has choclate in it. We keep track of the stuff in the grocery bag, Just like a variable keeps track of stuff.  

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

- userName holds a string
- isLoggedIn holds a boolean
- followers holds a number

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
Concatenation is putting 2 things together. 

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?
Youtube shows when how long ago a video was uploaded.

"uploaded" + videoUploadTime


9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)

If I have a just a string is it still okay to use a template literal:

```javascript
console.log( `I dont have any variables just a string` )
```
