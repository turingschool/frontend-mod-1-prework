## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

- Americorps introduced me to the concept of growth mindset, so I try to remind myself of this whenever I learn something new. I loved hearing about how learners tend to remember about 90% of what they learn when they teach others or use it immediately. I have done this before, but I'd like to work on this more because I've noticed that I really retain information better this way. I also definitely want to do a better job of "taking care of my brain" with regular exercise and better food. I don't eat as healthy as I should, so I'm going to try to create better habits, especially while I'm in Turing. The one thing that I'd add is hand-written notes. I find that physically writing out my notes is really helpful for me.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
Comparisions = Mathematical comparisons like greater than, less than, equal to, etc. Here we're comparing two different variables, usually numbers and strings, using mathematical operators.
    - Boolean = Boolean determines whether something is true or false and can also include mathematical operators as well.
    - String Comparisons = The initial task is to alphabetize letter by letter starting at index 0 and continuing along the string. If the strings are almost the same, then the longer string is chosen. If the strings are identical, then they are equal.
    - Strict Equality = uses 3 equals signs (===) to be more exact. Whereas, "6" and 6 would be equal (==), strict equality would recognize that they aren't the same.
    - Null and Undefined = A non-strict check would say that these are equal, however a strict check wouldn't. Null is equivalent to 0 and Undefined is equivalent to NaN.

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?
- console.log("Hello World!");

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?
- To comment in JavaScript, we use two forward slashes (Ex: // Then put out comment afterwards). Code comments can explain different portions of our code in regular language (English) to be helpful for other coders that may be looking at our code or even ourselves if our code starts getting really complicated.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
- A variable is like a placeholder for a data type that we will need to access regularly throughout our code. In 5-year-old terms, a variable is kind of like a nickname. We want to use something short so we don't have to write out long words or numbers a lot.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those - variables probably hold?
I (unfortunately) use Amazon a lot. Variables they probably use are: customerName (string), priceOfItem (float), and productCategories (array of strings).

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
- I know the word adding is used often, but in my head I usually refer to concatenation as smushing things together. Because we can concatenate "2" and "3" and we would get 23, rather than 5 (which we would get from true addition). So really we're just smushing strings or other variables together.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?
- Using the Amazon example, I think the developers would probably use concatenation to update the "deal of the day". I'd assume there is a string already prepared and each day, they just ()"smush" in) replace the previous deal of the day product with a new product. In a similar manner, when you purchase a product, the "Thank you for buying" + purchasedProduct is most likely a concatenation.

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
- I don't have any specific questions, but I do have something I just don't feel 100% comfortable with. I understand the idea of pseudocode, but I would be interested in going over it a little bit more especially when we get into even more complicated subjects.
