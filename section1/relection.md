## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

The SuperLearner article was encouraging to read because of the line at the end that said *"you don't have to be naturally gifted to be a super learner - you just need the right habits."* I already read a lot and I teach others what I know. I have been working on developing my growth mindset ever since I learned about it about 2 months ago. I **really** need to work on viewing learning as a process as I often just want the right answer and then to move on. I could also use more practice adapting my break schedule into short breaks instead of hours long. If I was going to add to the list, I would say that super learners have a stable routine.  

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
#### Data Types:
          1. String
          ..* Represents text and can contain any character, letter or number as long as it is all wrapped in either a "" or ''
          2. Interger
          ..*Must be whole number but can be negative or positive or neutral (0). No fractions or decimals.
          3. Float
          ..*Numbers that are negative or positive that contain decimal points. A fraction would be written as a decimal.
          4. Boolean
          ..*Used to evaluate if values are "true" or "false" only.  
          5. Array
          ..*represents a group of "like" types of data that are in the same collection/box.
          6. Object
          ..* Lets you store collections of data

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

`console.log("Hello World");`

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

// Double backslashes then text is a single line comment. And /* comment /* is used to write a multi line comment or to prevent a section of script to run. These comments explain what your code does or why you changed something and helps other developers understand why you did something. The nice part is that these comments won't interrupt your code.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

A variable is what we use to store a value or values so we can use it again in later code. Variable must be declared/created to exist. A variable can be a string, Integer or Number, Boolean, or an Array. I would tell a 5 year old that a variable is like box with a name or label such as chocolate candy box and it stores a value named peanut butter cup.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

The app that I am thinking of is Instagram. Three variables that are probably used on Instagram include strings, booleans, and arrays. Strings would hold the text, special characters, and numbers for account names and passwords. The boolean would answer true/false to validate maybe an account log in. The arrays could hold all of *accountName's* picture names. These could be set up together as an object such as the following...

```var samanthaBrown = {
accountName: = samanthaBrown,
password: = insertPassword,
accountName === password: = true,
pictures: = ["cat", "flower", "house"]
}
```

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

A concatenation is the way that programmers put together strings to complete or fill in variables in a line of code. It is represented with a plus sign +.

Example
```var animal = mouse;
console.log("Hello, I am a" + animal);
```

This will output "Hello, I am a mouse"

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?

The website that I am thinking of is Facebook. They must use concatenation on the top left hand corner of their webpage because it always says **Hello Samantha**. What the page is really saying is **Hello insertUserAccountNameHere**.

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)

I am confused by how I should be talking about numbers as a variable. In class we refered to numbers as either Integers or Floats but I haven't seen those terms used anywhere else and have just been using the word numbers to include both integers and floats. Is this acceptable?

How would I know on my own to use my terminal for a project? Same question about the console. It isn't clear to me how I would know the appropriate tool/program to use and why.
