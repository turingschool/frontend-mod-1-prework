## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
- It was interesting to learn about interpolation. I'm going to try to practice more of those exercises.
2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
- Each we learned during class in mod0. Boolean is true or false, strings are characters surrounded by quotes, integers are numbers, and floats are numbes with decimals.
3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?
- console.log("Hello World");
4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?
- // for single quotes or /* */ for multi line comments
5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
- A variable is a group of characters that are contained in quotes that are basically regular sentences.
6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?
- Google maps. search is a string, distance is a float, and time is a float.
7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
- It is how to include variables into a sentence no matter what the user inputs.
8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?
- Google maps. What your home is and your desintation.
9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
- How does someone know where to implement this code in a project?
