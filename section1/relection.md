## Section 1 Reflection

#### 1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it? ####

The SuperLearner Article is a list of habits that said what "super learners" do. It reminded me of productivity videos from Youtube and San Francisco tech culture. I realized that I take good care of my brain by eating well, reading and exercising. I want to start sharing what I learned so I can retain it better. I find that I tend to absorb a lot of information through books and podcasts but do not retain it because I seldom discuss/ teach it. I would add sleep to the SuperLearner list! It's important for brain function and memory.

#### 2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each. ####

  * __Strings:__ characters wrapped in quotes. Could be made up of numbers, letters, emojis or symbols
  * __Numbers:__ data types that handle all numbers/ digits including negative numbers and decimals (called floating point numbers)
  * __Booleans:__ evaluation of true or false statements

#### 3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console? ####

console.log("Hello World!");

#### 4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment? ####

Use double backslashes or combine an asterisk with a backslash to indicate a comment in JS.

__Example:__
(//This is a comment//)
(/*This is also a comment*/)

Code comment useful to explain what code is doing without having to read code.


#### 5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old? ####

A variable is a placeholder for a piece of information that may change. Let's say someone asked me my favorite animal.
One day I might say "My favorite animal is a leopard."
The leopard is a variable because a week later I changed my mind because I read a cool zoology book and say
"My favorite animal is a cheetah." I still have a favorite animal but my favorite animal changed.
I use variables for things that could change. Another way to think about it is how we greet people throughout
the day. In the morning we say "Good morning." At night we say "Good night." The "good" stays the same but the
rest of the greeting changes depending on the time of day.  

#### 6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold? ####

__App:__ Sankalpa Collective (local dance studio app)

__Variables:__ username, password, first name, class titles, class times, credit card info, greeting

__The data types in those are:__
+ Strings
  * Greeting I receive when I open the app
  * Class titles listed on the app
  * The variables here are my name and class titles
+ Booleans (true/false statement)
  * If my password matches my username
  * If my credit card information is correct
+ Characters
  * Password
  * Username
  * First names
  * Class titles
  * Class times
  * Credit card information
+ Numbers
  * Class times
  * Credit card information


#### 7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is. ####
Concatention is used to join multiple strings and variables in order to create one string.

#### 8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention? ####

With the Sankalpa Collective app, concatenation is used when I open the app and I receive a greeting. It
brings a general string together with the variable of my name so it looks something like this:
var name;
name = Gabby;

console.log(" Hey " + name + " ! " + " Ready to dance?! ");
So it reads "Hey Gabby! Ready to dance?!"

#### 9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option) ####
What's the easiest way to get into the readings and exercises without having to go through a file path?
Why use concatenation at all especially when interpolation is easier to read?
What are some practices to adopt a growth mindset?
If learning is a process and I have a goal for my learning, does it stop being a process once I have accomplished my goal?
