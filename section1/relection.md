## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
* Oh man! I took so much away from this because there has been nothing super about how I learn! üòÇ I'd say that firstly, I am committing to reading more. I've never been big on reading, my mind drifts very easily so I'll be looking up some tips and tricks on how to read better.
* I also VERY MUCH have a destination mindset. I've done some work with mastery at my previous job but, being honest, I didn't love it. And so I have some work to do here on shifting my mindset from destination to journey. I think Turing itself has already helped me along in this a bit with how the curriculum is structured, but I will still be actively working on it!
* Finally, the teaching others part really resonated with me. I absolutely love to teach and totally understand that teaching not only helps another but deepens my own understanding of the topic. I love love **LOVE** that! If I do well enough, and Turing wants to keep me around after I complete the program, I'd love to take on a part time teaching role. üòç #goals

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
* I learned about strings, numbers and booleans (oh my!).
* A string is a data type consisting of letters and characters all wrapped up cozily in quotes.
* Numbers are the simplest to me, because they are just that! Cute little numbers with minimal syntax. Numbers can be negative and/or have decimals ‚òÅÔ∏è
* Lastly, booleans üëª must have one of two values, true or false. They seem a bit scary because they can be pretty broad but really they are very neat in code!

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?
* Like this!
* var hello = "Hello World!"
* console.log(name);

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?
* two slashes, like this!
* // This is my two cents.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
* A variable is a declaration! Example:
* **Me to 5 year old:** Tell me what your favorite food is. **5 year old:** My favorite food is chocolate chip cookies. **Me:** Great, you've declared that your favorite food is chocolate chip cookies. So every time you say that you want your favorite food, I will give you a chocolate chip cookie UNLESS you tell me, at some point, that your favorite food has changed. **Boom.**

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?
* I live in the Target app. They absolutely use numbers because they need to know and show quantities of units of merchandise that is sellable. They also absolutely use booleans because they need to be able to tell me is a specific item that I want in a specific color and/or size is in stock and available for me to buy. Lastly, we know they have some strings up in there! Because when I add something to cart, I get an alert that says something like, 'Added to cart!'
Dang coding is cool.

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
The joining of data types with the cute little plus operator.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?
* Similar to my target response above, clothing retailers likely use concatenation all the time! If I see a shirt that comes in multiple colors and sizes, they'll likely join the shirt + the color + the size that I select via concatenation so that they can send that to the backend and let me know if that particular combination is in stock or not.

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
* I'm wondering about the console.log command and what that's actually doing behind the scenes. I didn't see a lot of info explicitly for that and it kind of confused me at the start.
