## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

After the first read through the article, I thought it was a pretty vague, stock list of good habits without much depth. I didn't make the connection of how it was going to affect my learning process. __HOWEVER__, after working through all the exercises in this section, I had to re-evaluate my approach, and try some different strategies. Two methods that I found useful right away were:  

- Researching the [Cornell Note Taking System](https://lsc.cornell.edu/how-to-study/taking-notes/cornell-note-taking-system/). Having been out of any type of formal learning environment for the past 20 years, I was struggling with how to take and organize my notes. _Especially_ during a live lesson. I would be furiously scribbling, and fall behind immediately. Utilizing this method will be far more helpful in organization and reviewing for future reference. It will take some practice, but i am already seeing a difference.

- Using the [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique#:~:text=The%20Pomodoro%20Technique%20is%20a,length%2C%20separated%20by%20short%20breaks.). Managing your productivity and rest times not only held you stay focused, but they also provide a sense of reward for any break you take. After each break, you feel refreshed and ready to continue forward.

Upon reviewing all of the materials for Section 1, the article started to resonate. My biggest takeaways were that I need to not be so harsh on myself for not understanding things immediately, and that trusting the process with a growth mindset, brings a much more positive approach to tackling challenging projects.  

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

  __Numbers__: this datatype is used to represent integers, positive or negative, and floating (decimals)  
  __Strings__: consist of letters, numbers, and other characters such as emoji wrapped in quotes `""`  
  __Boolean__: this datatype is used to ask a program a question that can be evaluated to one of two values `true` or `false`  

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

  `console.log("Hello World!");`

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

    Two backslashes `//` preceding any text will be omitted from the code and can be used for comments on one line

    For multiple lines, `/*followed by text here*/` will omit everything in between the opening backslash/asterisk and closing asterisk/backslash  

    Code comments are used to describe further what you are implementing, help others understand, or to omit code that is not going to run yet.  

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

    A variable `var` is a container that can hold specific information to use or reference later. There are different containers you can use to keep different things, like numbers or words.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

    Td Ameritrade

    Variable: Stock Ticker Search Data Type: String
    Variable: QTY to Buy or Sell Data Type: Number
    Variable: Confirming Purchase Data Type: Boolean  

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

    The joining of different variables to create one result. The data types can be mixed and resolved with _coercion_. JavaScript does this for us.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?

    TD Ameritrade (again!)

    _Concatenation_ is used to join strings together. It could be used in a confirmation message after a purchase. For example,

    "You chosen to purchase 2 tickets to the for Madison Square Garden on New Year's Eve."

    The number of tickets, place, and day, could all be different selections that are concatenated.

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)  

    __UPDATE__ While going through to check my work before submitting, I wanted to look at some of my reflections. I am leaving them in tact,
    but it should be noted that I no longer have these questions!!!

    _I have been trying to understand boolean data type a little bit better. By definition, it seems pretty straightforward, but in practice, I get confused on if I am supposed to structure the `operator` to give a true or false answer._  

    _For example, I got stuck on the Question referring to the `isHungry` variable in the Data Types excercises._
    _Am I supposed to enter what will give it false or true?_
    _In this case, I know that strings vs strings (==) will return a lexicographical result: "false"_
    _unless strict equality (===) is used in which the result would be "true"_

    _I know I am probably making this more confusing than it needs to be, I'm sure it will click soon..._
