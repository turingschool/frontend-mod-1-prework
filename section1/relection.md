## Section 1 Reflection

1. **How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?**

_The SuperLearner Article basically showed me that we should always be learning, adapting, and growing from our experiences.  Something that I have been doing is viewing learning as a process and have a growth mindset.  We as human beings should always strive to be a better version of ourselves.  I want to be able to teach others what I know and make a better habit of taking care of my brain/body.  If I could ad anything to this list, it would be to listen to piano music to stay focused!_

2. **What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.**

_The String is data type that can consist of any character, number, letter that are wrapped in quotations.  Quotations can be either single or double as long as they begin and end the same ('' , "")._

_The Number is a data type that deals with numbers. It can include negative numbers and decimals(floating numbers). Large numbers such as 4,500 will be written as 4500._

_The Boolean data type basically can be seen as an "on or off" switch. This allows the determination of a script that should be run in certain circumstances._


3. **How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?**

_var string = "Hello World!";_

_console.log(string);_

4. **What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?**

_The input you would use to indicate a comment in a JS file would be two forward slashes (//). The code comment helps identify the intention of the code written.  We can be more in-depth in trying to explain what the code will try to be doing._

5. **In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?**

_A variable is a way to store data for later use.  It basically like giving a pet a name that it will respond to._

6. **Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?**

_I'm sure that Youtube would use the variables of String, Booleans, Arrays. When someone is searching for a video, they might type in for example 'cryptocurrency'.  Maybe the array variable will group up words related to cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, etc. The boolean variable may somehow be integrated in the Search bar or like the Alarm functions.  String is probably prevalent in the majority of websites._

7. **In your own words, explain what concatenation is.**

_Concatenation basically means join together.  We would combine data with the plus sign(+)._

8. **Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?**

_Websites like Facebook that would need your personal information to be inputted. Maybe an example would be when you have to sign up and it asks for your First name and Last name in separate boxes resulting in those inputs to strings your name together in a profile header._

9. **What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)**

_I am super curious on how specifically codes / functions are implemented in everyday websites and to see it visually._
_How important is it to master Psuedocode?_
_What would be the specific duties for a job that requires javascript?_
