## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

  - I really enjoyed reading the SuperLearner article. There were a few things that really stood out from the reading that I would not have guessed and a few things that I could have guessed.  One thing that stood out to me was how much reading super learners typically consume.  Warren Buffet spending 5-6 hours a day reading different publications, wow!
  A couple things that I already do would include viewing learning as a process and taking care of my brain.  These seem most logical when I think about beginning to learn something new.  Learning a new skill or trade is going to take time and you can't expect to pick something up and be an expert right away.  As well, you have to give yourself the tools to succeed, first and foremost, taking care of your mind and body.  Making sure you are giving yourself the best opportunity to succeed involves taking care of the tools that you already have; your mind being the most important tool when trying to digest new information.
  I definitely need to read more!  I am a victim of terrible tv watching and that time is not giving me any more skills.  If I focus on taking at least 1 hour away from watching tv and invest that time into a book, what I'll be able to accomplish will be infinite!  I've learned the importance of taking breaks recently as well.  Growing up and going through school I would always try to pack as much information into my memory as possible shortly before I had regurgitate it for a test.  While most of it would be stored in short term memory and I could recall a lot of it, looking back, I really never got much of it into my long term memory.  
  The only thing I would potentially add would be to try to come into learning with a positive mindset.  This could potentially fall into "adopt a growth mindset", however, having a positive outlook with anything in life can make even the most tedious of tasks somewhat enjoyable.  

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

  - There were 3 different data types that I learned about during this section: strings, numbers and booleans.
  String: I would describe a string as a collection of characters that are wrapped inside quotations.  These characters can be letters, numbers, emoji's, or symbols
  var myString = "This is my string."
  Number: The number data type can be any integer (not in quotes), positive or negative, and would also include float (decimal) numbers as well.
  var favoriteNumber = 5
  Boolean: Boolean is a data type that returns one of two possible values; true or false.  It answers a lot of yes or no type of questions in programming.
  var isLearning = true

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

  - There are a couple of different ways you could log the string "Hello World!" to the console.  The first would be to save it to a variable name and call that variable name in a console.log statement.  
  ex: var greeting = "Hello World!"
      console.log(greeting); //
    The second possibility to log "Hello World!" would be to just call console.log to the string directly.
    ex: console.log("Hello World!")

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

  - You would use two backslashes in order to write comments in your JavaScript file.  We would use code comments to tell other developers what exactly our code is doing in speakable format.  We could also use code comments to limit what code is being run at a given time.  
  var greeting = "Hello World!"
  // console.log(greeting);  -> will not show our greeting in the console when we run the code snippet!

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

  - A variable allows developers to store bits of data in short term memory that could be referenced or changed later in code.  I would describe a variable to a 5 year old by trying to come up with an example that I could potentially sway the answer later.  I would ask what is your favorite dessert? Let's say they answer cookies. That answer would be our value that we assigned to their favorite dessert variable.  Then I may ask, what about ice cream?  Once they forget about cookies, they realize that ice cream is absolutely the best dessert, so their favorite dessert variable may need to be re-assigned to ice cream!  

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

  - On app that comes to mind is my RunKeeper app.  3 different variables that are used could be:
    var hasStartedRun = true; boolean because you either have or have not started running.
    var distanceInMiles = 3.2; number reflects the distance you've completed
    var runnerName = "Eric"; string as it contains a set of characters to describe who is running

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

  - Concatenation is the act of joining things together.  In what we have used in this lesson, it can be used to join strings or variables together using the "+" operator

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?

  - First thing that comes to mind is my online banking app.  After logging into the app, a welcome message comes up stating, "Welcome back Eric!".  A developer most likely used my input information in concatenation with a string of "Welcome back " + userName.

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)

  - So far everything has been pretty straight forward.  I have done some other courses to learn the basics of data types, concatenation, and variable declarations, so it was not the first time I was seeing the information that was presented.  No questions right now!
