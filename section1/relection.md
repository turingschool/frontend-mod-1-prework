 ## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

I need to improve on habit 1 (read a lot) and habit 4 (teach other what they know). I currently lack
habit 4 because I think myself is acting smart when teaching others and that can look annoying or pretentious. However sharing is very important in developers' community so I'll try be a good teacher along the way.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

number - data type that JS can perform math directly with;</br>
string - texts like they are printed out</br>
boolean - a status with only two values true or false

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

`console.log("Hello World!")`

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

`// single line comment`
`/* blah blah */` for multi-line comments.
Comments make codes easy to understand and follow.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

A labeled box that you can put anything in. You need to get rid of the old stuff before you put new stuff.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

The Weather Channel. Three varibles: location(string), temperature(number), sunset time(string).

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

Concatenation is joining strings like you play Scrabble. Each string is a piece of chips.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?

Temperature. They probably join a number and an uppper corner circle.

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)

I feel there's probably a lot more to learn in Git and Github. Maybe Turing will cover more as classes progress.
