## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

I do read a lot, and I do take frequent breaks. I'd like to get longer/more consistent sleep to help take care of my brain, although that's been a lifelong battle; and I'd like to work on my mindset as it pertains to process vs goals, because I seem to have a hard time keeping those balanced.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

String - characters, letters, words, phrases
Number - digits, number values, converted into objects
Boolean - true/false values

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

`console.log("Hello World!");`

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

// or /* */, depending on whether the comment is one line or multiple lines. You would use comments to deactivate parts of your code or to provide information for a person reading your code.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

An object you create to store some value, maybe like a box that holds a toy

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

YouTube
ex. searchTerms that takes strings from the search bar and combs video titles for matches
ex. category that takes strings from video titles and descriptions in order to sort videos into larger categories of interest
ex. timeStamp that accesses a certain minute-second value within the video

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

Joining multiple strings together

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?

DuckDuckGo, in converting phrases that are more commonly used as compound words

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)

What situations dictate using string concatenation over interpolation? I found interpolation to be much less of a hassle generally, especially for longer phrases

Is there a faster way to navigate directories other than repeating cd commands? Apologies if it's been mentioned and I'm just spacing on it

Why can't I modify a filename locally, if I've forked it? Tried to modify a typo ('relections.md') but it's read-only
