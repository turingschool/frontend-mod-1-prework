## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
  I really enjoyed this read and I'm going to put them into practice. I do number 2 and number 6 I also do number 3 but I'm usually the one being taught by others. I get that learning is a process and not a destination. It's good to always keep learning and keep that mindset that theres only a certain amount of learning to be done. I also know that taking short break s its great for learning, not just because the brain is being overloaded with information so the brain needs time to actually process it and store it. I really need to read more and eat healthier. I think that having a good nights rest is also important for learning. when you're well rested you retain information better.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
   string- are a sentence or text value given to this data type.
   integer- are numbers negative or positive (no fractions or decimals)  boolean- are true or false statement values.

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?
  There are two ways of doing this.
```JavaScript

var greeting = "Hello World!"
console.log(greeting);
//or
console.log("Hello World!");
```
4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?
  The purpose of a code comment can be to explain a line of code in more description for other developers using our code to understand, or to block out a line of code temporarily.
```javascript
// foward slash
/* and */
```
5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
  A variable is like a container which stores 
6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?
 I'm a big amazon shopper, so I use the amazon app a lot.
 three variables are probably


7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
  Concatenation helps us add things together in our code. Like a string to a number, or a string to a declared variable.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?


9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
  How and why is possible to use concatention. I thought every string or data type had to be assigned to a variable. I don't understand how and why this is possible to do.
  ```javascript
  var speedy = "quick red fox";
  var slowPoke = "lazy brown dog";

  console.log("The " + speedy + " jumped over the " + slowPoke);
// "The" and "jumped over the" are not assigned to a variable.
  ```
