## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
(If I found the correct article:) One section of the article that resonated with me was point number four: teaching others what you know. While this makes sense, I wouldn't have expected to see it on the list. I think teaching others is definitely a great tool to make sure you know the material enough to break it down and simplify it for someone else, and to share the wealth. Something I already do is read a lot, as it always helps me understand concepts more. I need to be more mindful about taking short breaks. I have the tendency to run myself to the ground, and then need a very long break to make up for it. I will attempt to incorporate short breaks more often.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
The data types from this section included Strings, Booleans, and Numbers.
A String can be represented using letters, characters, or numbers and have to be wrapped in quotes.
A Boolean results in either a true or false answer, and can help the computer make sense of which way the script will go.
A Number is a data type that deals with numbers, whether negative or positive, as well as decimals, or floating point numbers.  


3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?
``` var welcome = "Hello World!"
console.log(welcome)
```

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?
YOu can use two slashes ( ``//`` ) for a single line (typically short) comment. For a longer comment, you can use an intro forward slash and asterisk, and end the comment with an asterisk and forward slash. ``/* text goes here */``. Code comments are used to help describe the purpose and intention a code was written, for current or future programmers to refer to.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
A variable is used to store small bits of information, which will help you reach your goals in your script.
5 Y.O. Explanation: A variable helps you teach your computer what you want it to do by giving it a small piece, like a puzzle piece, at a time before it helps you create the entire piece. Each variable is like a puzzle piece.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?
An app I use frequently is Twitter.
Variable 1: `var username = 'Lourdes'` = This will prompt my Twitter app to welcome my page. This is a string datatype.
Variable 2:  Another datatype is a Boolean which results in true or false depending on whether the username and password match.
Variable 3: Another datatype is a Number when age is requested to sign up for the app.

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
A concatenation is a way to help connect information from several variables together to present a new, comprehensive string that has a full meaning rather than individualized pieces from a simple variable.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?
Gmail likely uses concatention to connect my `var name = Lourdes` to the welcome message when opening my email.

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
I realized that I struggled to think of real life applications for how sites/apps would use these variables, concatentions, etc, in their coding. I will likely need to take a step back and find resources to help me make sense of this information and see how it can all be applied.
