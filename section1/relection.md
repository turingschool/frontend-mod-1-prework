## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

The SuperLearner Article resonated with me in many of the tips! Being a person who loves to learn, I always find it fascinating to understand how learning happens, how to be a better learner, and how to more efficiently retain information. Particularly, habits five and six are things I have utilized and found very helpful. These are taking care of my brain and taking short breaks early and often. Eating healthy, sleeping for enough hours, mediating, and excersing I have all used in past school programs to help me stay healthly and sharp, as well as what I do now to continue to function at my best. Taking breaks has also always worked very well for me. I love the short breaks we have been doing in Module 0, as I have found setting goals of work that take about 30 minutes help be to stay very focused and motivated, because I know I have a break coming up and they are achievable goals. Personally I would love to incorporate more of habits two, three, and four, which are viewing learning as a process, adopting a growth mindset, and teaching other what I know. I seek to be more in the moment, enjoying and staying commited to the learning journey as opposed to only looking at the end goal. Having a growth mindset has helped me move from feeling inadequate in a lot of areas and more motivated to commit to learning and staying confident in my abilities. I seek to embrace this mindset even more during my tim at Turing. Whether it is talking with my cohort, family or friends, or or in the future tutoring or mentoring others, I seek to knowledge-share not only to support others in their goals but to solidfy the things I am learning as well.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

This section focused on the data types of Numbers, Strings, and Booleans. 

Numbers: This data type includes all numbers. These can be decimals (floating point numbers), and positive and negative numbers. Examples include 29, -19, 11.99, 209899, etc.

Strings: This data type can include any characters, letters or numbers that are wrapped in quotations (double or single). Example: "Hello!" or "I love 10 toppings on my pizza", etc.

Booleans: This data type is either true or false or could possibly answer yes or no. Example: 8 < 1; false

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

var greeting = "Hello World!";
console.log(greeting);

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

The purpose of code comment is to add in information for other developers within our code and/or de-activate certain parts of our code that we may not want to run. It can also provide short desciptions for what our code is doing. The characters would include for single line comments: // or for double line comments: /* */. 

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
A variable in a place that data is stored, which will ultimately be a part of a script that is run. It can change or vary depending on the value we give it. I would tell a 5 year old that a variable is like a chore list where you learn what you need to do. It can change depending on the day.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

I use Strava a lot! Variables could include profileName (string), location (string), distanceRun (integer -float). 

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

Concatenation invovles joining together strings using the + sign JavaScript. This can include various data types. 

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?

I think about Amazon. They probably use concatenation in lines that showcase names, addresses and additional info.

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
Questions:
 - Is Interpolation used more frequently by developers than Concatenation?
 - I seek to learn more about all the math symbols/operators that can be used in JavaScript.
 - What do the best developers do to stay committed to learning and growth?
 - Are many of these things we are learning that are related to JavaScript similar in other programming languages?
