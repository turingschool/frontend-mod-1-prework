## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

You can change how well you are able to learn by changing your though process
about how you think of learning, and your own abilities.
Since starting Mod 0 I have started to take regular breaks for concentration.
I would like to do a better job of taking care of my brain, both in diet, and
in getting enough rest.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
  * String - Contains letters, numbers, and or special characters wrapped in quotes
  * Number - Handles all numbers, including integers and floats
  * Boolean - Evaluates to either true or false

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

`console.log("Hello World!")`

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

// single line comments are indicated with double slashes

/* multiline comments are indicated with a slash asterisk wrapping around the
entire comment*/

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
It's a named value, that you can assign other values to.

A variable is another name for something, so you can talk about it in different ways.
Like how you can call your teacher, "teacher" or you could call her "Ms. Ball"

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?
YouTube
  * playVideo - Boolean
  * videoTitle - String
  * playbackLocation - Number

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

Concatenation is joining different variables and or data types together.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention? //cocatenation is misspelled here

Bandcamp - When showing an album it shows "Album Title" by "Artist" which probably looks something like `console.log(albumTitle + " by " + artistName)`

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
