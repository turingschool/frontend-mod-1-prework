## Section 1 Reflection

### 1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

This struck me as pretty *straight forward* overall, but there were some very useful nuggets of information that I took away.

Firstly, the basic idea that learning is a process and not a destination stood out as very important. I should wield the learning process as a tool that is to be used often, not as a means to an end. Also, adopting a growth mindset will keep me on the right path to getting as much as I can out of Turing, and will keep me sharp once I enter the professional world.

One concept that I find I use in my own life is teaching others. There is no better way to cement a concept in your own brain than having to distill it into teachable steps for someone else to digest. This in a way is what we will be doing when we write code.

I might add one thing to the list (which really just piggy-backs on the first point) which is to stay curious about a wide range of topics. Reading a lot fills you with a lot of information, and having a range of curious interests may help to give perspective on how to approach problems or inspire new projects.

### 2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

* **Numbers** can be any type of integer including positive numbers, negative numbers, or floating-point (*decimals*)

* **Strings** are letters, numbers, or characters wrapped in " " or ' '

* **Booleans** are a data type that answers to a _true_ or a _false_ value and answer yes or no questions.

### 3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

` console.log("Hello World!"); `

### 4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

+ For a single line comment you would use // and everything after on the line is commented out.

+ For a longer or multi line comment you would wrap your comment in /* */

+ We do this so that javascript ignores our comments. These comments are handy messages to yourself and other developers that can add explanation and context to your code.

+ It can also be handy to use comments to deactivate sections of code while testing.

### 5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

A variable is how we store specific values that we can insert into our code in any place we want. Variables are also handy because we can change the declaration of a variable easily, without having to go into our code and manually change it line by line. I might tell a 5 year old child that a variable is how we remember a description of something when we are telling a story. If we know an apple is described as *red*, the apple will be *red* throughout the whole story. 

### 6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?
I use the site Poshmark to buy used clothes online. Three variables that are probably used would be
  * my clothing sizes which would hold numbers or strings.
  * my brand preferences which would hold strings.
  * my shipping address which would hold strings.

### 7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

Concatenation is the joining of variables into strings using a specific syntax- '' or "" and the + operator.

### 8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?

Netflix will greet me each time I log into the app with a sentence, "Welcome back, Mark." which would use a name variable that is inserted into the string `console.log("Welcome back," + name + ".");`

### 9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)

+ Why would one use concatenation over interpolation, or visa-versa? It it a style preference or does one have situational benefits that the other may not have?
+ Are code comments to be written in the imperative voice like a git comment is?
