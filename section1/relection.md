## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
I loved the superLearner Article! I was relieved to realize that a lot of those things are luckily things I've already incorporated into my life over the years. I love to read and do it often, and one of my favorite things to do is to teach people what I just learned. It really helps me solidify the information I just absorbed and I've been doing that for years! I think I could definitely eat healthy more consistently, and could be much better at taking breaks. I get sucked into working and forget to get up and decompress for a moment.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
In this section in particular, we learned about the following:
**Number** is a data type that essentially deals with all numbers. They can be positive, negative, or zero. They can also be decimals or *floats*.
**String** is a data type that contains letters, spaces, special characters, or numbers, wrapped in quotes. You can use double or single quotes, as long as it's consistent.
**Boolean** is a data type that represents a true or false statement. Booleans often use comparison *operators* (===, <, >) to determine whether or not something is true or false. They are also used to help answer questions of whether or not passwords match, credit card information is proper, etc.


3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?
`console.log("Hello World!");`

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?
The characters used to indicate code comments in JavaScript are //, followed by the comment. The purpose of a code comment is to communicate with collaborators why you chose to do something, what's expected to happen, or to temporarily disable a line or block of code if you don't want it to run quite yet.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
A variable is a way that we give something a meaning. The best way I'd explain it to a 5 year old is by using their age as an example (age is fun for kids!). Explaining that their age variable = 4 (or however old they are).

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?
Let's use Instagram for an example, because we all know how addicting that is.
I'm assuming Instagram uses:
var password (Boolean)
var numberOfLikes (number)
var userName (string)

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
Concatenation is a way that we can combine or join two or more data types by using the + operator.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?
Let's use Amazon for an example. When you arrive on the homepage, assuming you're logged in still, it greets you with "Hello, Michann Stoner!" and I'm assuming a simple form of concatenation is used there. "firstName + lastName"

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
I guess I still have a lot of questions about how to write useful variable and method names so that it's clear and concise for other people who may be reading the code. I also realize that this will likely come with lots of practice and repetition. I also think that I move just a little slow with Git, but don't have any major pressing questions at the moment regarding that.
