## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

I thought the article was really informative and have already been reading more. I generally try to read books but have been distracted with stuff on my phone lately, so instead of scrolling social media in the morning I've been reading books instead. Things I already do from this list are teaching others what they know and eating healthy. Lately I haven't been able to do much teaching, but I did that a lot at my last job and found it difficult sometimes. I would like to incorporate taking more breaks, and especially cultivating an ADAPTABLE mindset. I am very stubborn and I think that trying to do this would be my best take-away from this article. I would add that reviewing what you have learned later in the day usually helps my learning process. Also, I think it's super helpful to do exercise while taking your learning breaks.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

string - a data type representing text. Use quotation marks to designate a string.
number - a data type representing a numerical value, or number.
boolean - a data type representing a value that is either true or false.

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

console.log("Hello World!");

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

You can add a single line comment with // or a multiple line comment starting with /* and ending with */. Comments are useful for giving more information to other developers, or to deactivate parts of our code that we want to temporarily keep from running.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

A variable is a way to store data. I would explain it to a 5 year old like this: Think of a Post Office box. You can put all kinds of different things in the box - a package from Amazon, a paycheck, a post-it or it could be empty. The variable is a slip of paper from your mom saying which Post Office box to go to. The information on the slip of paper can change, as well as what is inside the box.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

My current favorite site is
https://www.larimer.org/health/communicable-disease/coronavirus-covid-19/larimer-county-positive-covid-19-numbers
Three variables are
Risk score - string
New Positive Cases in last 24 hours - integer
Risk score tab/Cases tab/Deaths tab/Outbreaks tab/Colorado Counties tab - boolean (depending on which is clicked to be active).


7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

Concatenation is linking things together. You can use concatenation to join strings together.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?

Using the same site linked above, I think that most of the percentage numbers listed at the bottom of the page are probably concatenations from data that changes everyday.

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)

Why do we have to put semi-colons at the end of all our lines of code in JS?
