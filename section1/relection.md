## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

* I enjoyed the article and felt validated by some of my learning styles I currently use. I very  much agree with the article. I believe in my practice I already have a growth mindset (otherwise I wouldn't be at Turing!), I feel I am adaptable and can change my thought patterns, I'm someone who takes health seriously and believe diet can exercise can prevent many chronic diseases, I also enjoy learning and feel like it is a journey and want to continually improve my knowledge and mental state my whole life. I do think I need to initiate taking more breaks into my routine, I have a tendency to go hard for a long period of time and then take larger breaks, and I would like to utilize the teaching method more often, as I really believe that is a test of true knowledge. I would like to incorporate speaking out loud to my partner and classmates in practice and learning times. If I were to add to the list, I might add a section about creating a system of note taking that helps one to stay organized. When you have a lot of knowledge coming in, I think it helps to create a mental map of the information by creating your own sections and sub sections, this might be an extension of the teaching point.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

* string: This data type includes letters or other characters and uses "" or '' to indicate it is a string.

* number: This data type includes numbers and does not use quotes.

* Boolean: This data type evaluates and produces a true/false result and does not use quotes

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

* console.log("Hello World");

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

* //single line comments
* /* multiple line comments */

We use comments to help clarify the code for ourselves or others who are looking at the code for the first time, or if we haven't looked at it in a while. It makes it easier to follow and understand. You can also use comments to temporarily stop a block of code without deleting it. You may want to re-use it later or you may want to show what you edited for yourself or other people who read the code.


5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

* A variable is what we use to store temporary data that we need for a script. In other words, it is like a drawer we put a certain toy in. For example this drawer is for legos and this drawer is for crayons.


6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

* I use my email app. It would probably use:

* var userName = "username string" (string)
* var password = "password string" (string)
* var checkBox = true/false (Boolean)


7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

* Concatenation means to "join together". It is used to join different data types together using a (+) operator.


8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?

* I use fitbit. They might use concatenation when it reports my activity goals for each hour if I indicated I wanted that report. So, it tells me "well done! you have been active 5/9 hours today" I believe they are using concatenation to report to me "Well done! you have been active" + activeHours + "today". I'm sure it is way more involved but that is how I feel the basic set up goes.


9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)

* When you use concatenation, we saw an example of how JavaScript uses type coercion to give us a result of string. Is there an example of when JavaScript would use type coercion to give us a different data type like a number or Boolean?

* What is best practice in JavaScript, using "" or ''?

* I noticed a lot of the comments in this repository uses single line comments. Is there a best practice for when to use single line comments and multiple line comments.
