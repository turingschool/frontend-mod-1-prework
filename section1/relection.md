## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?  
   -I was (and have been) really interested in the parts of the article that talked about **stretching the brain**. This is something that is important to me. I study psychology and have had to learn about degenerative neural diseases, such as Alzheimer's. I know the importance of continuously challenging one's brain, eating healthy, and getting exercise. This article encouraged me to read more. I need to be more conscious about a regular routine of reading.  
   -I need to **value the process** of reading and do it simply because it's good for me...instead of simply trying to accomplish a goal or learn a new skill.  
   -I already employ the skill of **teaching others**. I know it's important to repeat/rehearse lessons. We encode information in our brains by being exposed to it in several different ways. Even when there's no one around to teach something to, I often pretend that I am speaking to someone, and try to describe something in laymen's terms. This helps me encode the information in a more effective way.  
   -I loved that downtime was mentioned (**taking short breaks often**). This is something that so many of us view as a luxury but not a necessity, when it actually is a necessity. I loved that this article even described the ideal study session length: 30-50 minutes. It's important to be able to recognize the way in which our minds and bodies work best. When we have this information we can best tap into our potential.  
2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.  
   -Number- These are numbers. Numbers can be negative, positive, and can be in decimal format.  
   -String- Strings are encased in quotes (double or single quotes) and can be made up of letters, numbers, and symbols.  
   -Boolean- Boolean values use comparison operators to return a value of true or false. These are used to then activate a certain event or line of code, depending on whether true or false is returned.  

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?  
   -console.log("Hello World!");  

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?  
   -You can use two backslashes for comments (//These are my comments in code) or you can get fancy and use "/*" to encase your comments. We use comments to explain our code better and to keep things clear, so that other programmers (and ourselves) can easily understand what is going on. It's good to develop of habit of developing comments and annotating about what you're coding.  
5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?  
   -A variable is a way of telling JavaScript that we want it to remember something. For example, we'll tell JavaScript to remember that our dog's name is Spot. That way, when we talk about our dog later, JavaScript knows that our dog's name is Spot. Let's say that later we want to talk about our neighbor's dog. We can then tell JavaScript that dog now stands for Fido. When we talk about a dog in the future, JavaScript will now know we're talking about Fido.  
6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?  
   -On Instagram I'm sure they use variables when it comes to signing up for an account. There's probably variables for firstName, lastName, userName, emailAddress, age/birthdate, etc. Once you've entered this information in, this can be used to interact with the user in a more personalized way, such as displaying your name in a personalized greeting when you log in. Most of these fields would be string data types: your name, username, email address. Your age, phone number, or parts of your address would be number data types. These also could be boolean data types because certain fields will need to return a true or false (such as inputting an email address that is valid/in the correct format).  

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.  
   -Concatenation is when you are linking or joining together strings and values from variables that you have already assigned/declared. You can print out a linked together string that combines variable values with other strings. Concatenation uses the plus (+) operator to join strings and variable names.  

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?  
   -On Amazon's site, concatenation is used when the browser displays personalized messages. Your name (and particular details about you) is stored in variables and then the site uses these values in a concatenated string, to give you a message that includes your name.  

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)  
   -Do we have to use semicolons after the console.log print outs? I noticed in several of the examples (in the exercises files) that semicolons were not used after a console.log command. It didn't seem to affect whether or not it would be printed out in the terminal. Is this just a good practice to get into doing but isn't actually always necessary?
