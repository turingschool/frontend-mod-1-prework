## Section 1 Reflection

**1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?**
 
 - What I mainly learned from the Superlearner article was, that my brain works alot like my muscles. Continue to push it hard it gonna start losing steam and continue to work slower and slower. What I already did from the list given was that I already have been teaching people what I have learned. The reason why I did this before I even read about it in the article was because I found it to be a really good way to study! What I'm gonna start doing more often is just overall mini breaks. I was always a grinder in the way that I would just continuously keep grinding at the work without giving my brain any breathing room. Overall I think the only thing I would add to this list is like hobbies and such. Find something that keeps your brain active that you enjoy and that makes you happy.

**2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.**
 
 -Script : Instruction manual but for you computer
 -String : A computer sentence you tell your computer to do.
 -Number : A data type that will handle all forms of numbers
 -Boolean : A data type that handles true or falses
 -Concentation : Using variables during your string.
 -Interpolation : An easier way for writing Concentation
 
**3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?**

var boom = 'Hello World'
console.log(boom)

**4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?**

 -  // Is used for single line code comments, usually used for small descriptions of code //
 -  /* Is used for multi-line code comments, usually put next to your code to show how the script works. */

**5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?**

 - A variable is and object that we create and show to a computer. We can use it for our scripts as long as we give it a function. Or we can just create for a simple string as well.
 - The best way for me describe it a child is just by drawing a picture. Because a picture is anything you make and we can tell whoever what the picture is of.

**6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?**

 - An app I use frequently is of course Twitter. Three variables that are most likely used are something along the lines of
 var username = {                 var interest = {                                    var trending = { 
 
 name = 'blank',                  name = 'smash',                                     name = 'Nairo',
 
 age = '32' ,                     game = [Ultimate , Melee , Smash 4],                tweets = '14560'
 
 isAdult = 'True'                 isPro = false                                       platforms = [Twitch,Youtube]
 }                                }                                                   }

**7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.**

 - A series of variables or objects connecting together.

**8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?**

 - A site that most likely uses alot of concatention is within youtube. The reason I believe this and where I think they use it is wiithin their algorithim. They are adding alot of different variables to connect you a wide array of youtubers that you may like.

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
 
 - I have lots of questions but I feel as we progress with sections they will be answered. My biggest question however, is why would you ever use concatention over interpolation? It just seems like a time save to use primarily interpolation.
