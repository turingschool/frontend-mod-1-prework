## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?  
I definitely do not take enough breaks, and I am making it a habit to use the marinara timer.  It's a great application that holds me accountable so I *make* myself takes breaks now. I also try to read a lot, although when school starts I may not have as much time.  My goal is to shut down all electronics and read for 15-20 minutes before bed while in school.  Teaching others is a great way to make something stick in your brain, and I will have to find study partners to talk things out after we learn something.  I would probably add improving your learning environment to the list, free of distractions.  Move your phone with social media on it *across* the room.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.  
Numbers: can be floats (numbers with decimals) or integers (whole numbers including 0), don't need quotation marks, can be negative or positive
Booleans: true or false statements, need to be lowercased and don't need quotation marks  
Strings: can be any type of character as long as it's within quotation marks  

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?   
console.log("Hello World!");  

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?  
You can either do this by typing // before your comment or writing your comment like this: /* comment */  
Sometimes you need to be more descriptive about your code for other coders to see, so comments can be helpful.  It's also very useful when working out bugs in your code, so you can temporarily disable parts of the code without deleting it.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?  
Variables can be anything! They allow us to place value to a thing, and then we can reassign the value throughout our coding. We can use variables to manipulate data and for concatenation. Variables are placeholders for bigger groups of data so we can easily call the information.   

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?  
Noracooks.com is a website for vegan recipes.   Each recipe that gets posted has a time assigned to it for prep time and for cook time.  The website allows you to sort recipes based on how long it takes to prep and cook.  The website could then use a boolean to lump a recipe with others if the prep and cook time is <30 minutes.  
They use strings for recipe names, which changes for reach recipe.  
Some recipes let you double the amount of servings, so it would double the ingredients for you.  So the variable would be the ingredients and the numbers associated with them would be doubled.

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.  
Concatenation means to join together.  It's a way to combine different things into the same expression.  These can be previously declared variables, or any other data type. You can combine them to form sentences.  

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?  
Almost all websites that have you log in use concatenation for their greeting.  For example, the var name would be your first name, so when you log in, the website would say "Hello, Sarah!" so you know who is logged in.

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)  
Boolean statements! They will always be my achilles heel! I think there's a typo in the dataTypes.js file, otherwise I *really* don't understand boolean statements.  But what's the difference between == and ===? The examples had === but I thought booleans were ==, unless == is true and === is false.  I don't know why I can't understand them!  

So I am rereading my responses before the prework due date, and Booleans definitely make *more* sense to me now that I have finished all of the prework and am going back through again.  Still don't feel 100%, but not quite as shaky! === is strictly equal, !== is not equal.
