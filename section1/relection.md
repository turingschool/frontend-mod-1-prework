## Section 1 Reflection
1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you?
- I have heard repeatedly the insight that reading is important to personal growth and success, and the link between high achievers and consistent reading. Thus I have begun to relate to that as simply fact.
- The observation of how information is the new currency is also something I related to. Just the other day I was explaining to a friend one of  my many motivations for my career change. I was admitting that though I am skilled in my current field (I can pair wine with food quite easily and speak in length about outstanding winemakers), I feel it would help me to have skills and knowledge that are truly deeply valuable to society at large. I think the most important reason for going into tech is that I believe I will enjoy it and it will continually challenge me, though wanting to build needed knowledge (the new form of currency as he describes) is important as well.

What from this list do you already do?
- In my job as essentially a sommelier in a wine store I teach others about the differences between varietals and bottlings and through this I learn and remember more about the subject. Thus in a very natural way I use the teach to learn technique.  I also have been getting more consistent with taking frequent breaks by using a Pomodoro timer.

Want to start doing or do more of?
- I definitely would like to develop a habit of reading more. I have been listening to audiobooks more lately but mostly to help me go to sleep. The actual act of reading and taking notes on what I’ve read will be an important process to develop in order to keep growing. I could also use more vegetables and blueberries daily.

Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
- I would add the importance of quality sleep and frequent exercise to the list.  In the book “Peak Performance”  the authors walk through study upon study about the importance of sleep in both academic and athletic performance. In addition, moving ones body is well known to increase lifespan, increase overall health, and increase happiness, all important aspects for better learning.

1. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
- Number - a number 0, positive, or negative that can have a decimal point but cannot have a fraction
- Boolean - data that can be either true or false. This type of data can be very helpful when the script is essential like a flow chart. False would go one direction, true another.
- String - letters, numbers, or special characters that are set off in quotation marks. A number in quotation marks becomes a string and is not used in the same way as the number data type.

1. How would you log the string “Hello World!” to the console?
console.log (“Hello, World!”);

1. What are the characters you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?
'//'' Single Line Comment- everything beyond this mark on that code line is read by the JS interpreter as a comment
'/* */' Comment Block or Same Line as Active Code- Open and Closing Comment, everything between the two symbols (whether it’s just a few words on a line or several lines) is read as a comment
Purpose:
- Comments can give the reasoning behind different decisions in code construction for other developers that may read the code
- Comments can be used to make certain parts of the code inactive

1. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
- A variable is a way to contain data (sometimes very complex data) by assigning the data to a word or phrase. This functions as a way to store data, communicate changing data, and makes the data more useable in a script.
- To explain variables to a 5 year old- I would first ask their name (say it’s Jacob). I would then say “What is an easier way to get your attention? Option one, ‘Jacob!’; or option two ‘5 year old boy with brown hair, freckles, a blue shirt, blue pants, and short hair’. A name is assigned to a person by their parents to make communicating with and about them easier.  This is just like how we’d assign a name (we’d call this the variable name) to information in code (the variable value) to make it easier to use through our program.”

1. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?
- Whoop Fitness Tracking App- every morning it asks me to “journal”. First question - Did I have caffeine the previous day? And asks:
- 1- True or False, Boolean Data Type
- 2- If True How many servings? Number Data Type
- 3- When was your last serving? Number Data Type
This would all potentially be stored as variables that would then be used in their monthly analysis of how my caffeine habits correlated with my recovery score. In addition, that recovery score is created using number data stored as variables (hrs of sleep, heart rate variability, resting heart rate) and then likely stored as a variable itself to calculate and show how much activity I should undertake that day as a result of that rest score.

1. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
Con means “with” when used as a root or in Spanish. Catenation is when an element within a molecule forms a bond with another element within the same molecule to form a chain or ring. So the fact that the two combined means “joining one data type with the same or different data type to form a joined outcome” makes sense. With concatenation a string data type can be joined with a number data type to produce a string result.

1. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?
In the cycling/running social media app Strava it seems like they’d have two different data types, a string and a number, being joined together in the following sentence to make the data seem like it was written by a Strava editor just for me:  “Cloudy, 51F. Feels like 51F”

1. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
- I’m curious about (and I’ll have to look into it after I finish the PreWork) what is the difference mentioned between var and let/const. The lesson describes these as less nuanced.
- I also remember hearing about how JS is different then Java partly because in JS you don’t have to assign every piece of data a variable? Maybe I am misremembering this but it is definitely something to research.
