## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
    - The concept of learning as a process resonated with me a lot. I really enjoy the learning process and like to think that we all have something to learn always, even if someone is an expert. Similarly, I tend to approach challenges with a growth mindset and see them as an opportunity to grow as a person.
    - The article definitely made me want to improve my reading habits. I love reading but have noticed myself skimming way too often and that doesn't help me retain the information.
    - In addition, it is a goal of mine to improve my teaching skills. I have never seen myself as a teacher and sometimes I struggle to explain myself, so this is definitely a growth area for me.
    - The article also inspired me to reflect on the ways I take care of my brain (e.g., exercise, sleep) and things I should be more mindful of (e.g., what foods I consume). I also would like to start following a system of short breaks (Pomodoro technique) because I tend to power through and only take breaks when I am exhausted.
    - I would add to the list to always find things to learn from other people. As much as teaching is helpful to learn, it is also important to learn from others and be curious about their path.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

      In this section we learned about three data types:
      - **String**: it is a data type consisting of letters and other characters, which are wrapped inside single or double quote marks.
      - **Number**: data type that handles numbers (either positive or negative) and decimals (floating point numbers). Not having them inside strings, allows us to use them for mathematical operations.
      - **Boolean**: data type which evaluates two values: true or false. It is helpful when asking yes/no questions and helps determine which script should run.    

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?
  ```JavaScript
  console.log("Hello World!");
  ```
4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?
    - The purpose of code comments is to add information about our code in our written language, for other developers to understand our code. It can also be used to temporarily de-activate code.
    - To indicate comments in JavaScript you press the following keys: CMD + / --which shows double backslash. Or you can wrap the comment with /* -- this works for multiple lines of code.
  ```JavaScript
// This is my comment
  console.log("I will run");
 // console.log("I will not run");
/* Nothing inside of this will run,
This line either */
  ```

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
    - A variable is a container for information (data). It has a name (which describes what it holds) and it has a value (which is the thing it holds). For example, a variable called animal could be assigned to elephant and that means it holds an elephant. But if we substitute the elephant with a horse (reassign), now it has a horse. üêò ->üê¥

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?
    - The Instagram app holds username, firstName, lastName, which would all be string variables.

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
    - Concatenation is the joining together strings and variables, using the plus operator.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?
    - In the notifications in Instagram they probably use concatenation. For example they say username requested to follow you.

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
    - What type of data is date of birth? How are dates categorized?
    - Is interpolation better than concatenation? Why would someone choose one method over the other?
    - What are "real life" examples in which a developer would re-assign variables and its uses?
