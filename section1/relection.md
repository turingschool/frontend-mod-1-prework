## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

I think I'm pretty good at practicing most of these - especially at viewing learning as a process, teaching others what I already know, and knowing when to take short breaks - but I could surely improve across the board.  The main thing I want to work on is reestablishing this "growth mindset" - remembering that instead of just piling new knowledge on the old, it's important to question and dismantle old ways of thinking and build new ones in their place.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

We learned about Numbers, Strings, and Booleans.  Numbers are just any numbers - positive, negative, or decimal / floating point.  Strings are blocks of alphanumeric/symbolic text wrapped in single or double quotes.  The Boolean data type is essentially a "light switch," always returning a value of either 'true' or 'false'.

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

// console.log("Hello World!");

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

// the purpose is to either deactivate parts of our code that we want to temporarily disable
/* or to explain our intentions/reasoning, either for our own reference or for future  developers who might need clarification */

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

A variable is like a small box, but to use it we have to give it an appropriate label first, then we can put that kind of stuff inside, and if we do that right we can put it wherever we want in the house and easily find it and use it later.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

I use iMDB a lot, and I'm sure every movie listing has a number variable for the date the movie was released, a Boolean variable for whether or not that movie is "out" (true/false for release date <= today's date), and a string variable describing in words where the movie premiered.

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

Taking multiple variables and fusing them together into one cohesive string.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?

I'm sure Wikipedia uses concatenation all the time - whenever a user submits additional info to a page, the new text is juxtaposed onto the pre-existing block of text.

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)

I couldn't get the 'clear' or 'rm -rf' functions to work in the Terminal Playground, could I have been using them wrong?
