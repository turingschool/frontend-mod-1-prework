## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
  - Overall the article was a good read and has a lot to offer in the context of learning to code
  - I already view learning as a process and try my best to maintain a growth mindset
  - I look forward to reading more and eating better to take care of my brain
  - One thing to add is to never assume you are a 100% right  

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
  - String: generally text or consisting of characters wrapped in quotes
  - Number: any numerical value including negative numbers
  - Boolean: either a true or false value

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?
    ```javascript
    console.log("Hello World!");

    ```

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?
  ```javascript
  // Comments are useful for explaining areas, steps or results of code to other developers

  ```

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
  - A variable is like a container for a value you want to use later. The name of the variable is like putting a label on that container

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?
  - email and password : string
  - followers : number
  - whether they are live : boolean

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
  - concatenation is the merging of strings and variables to produce a combined string

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?
  - When adding "salt" during password encryption

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
  - In what kind of situations would you choose concatenation over interpolation?
