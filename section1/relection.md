## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

I already try to teach to others the things I know. I read a lot about the things I'm interested in.
I've  been adopting a growth mindset, where I forgive myself if I couldn't do something in the past. I try to see what
I can do now and am thankful and grateful for what I can accomplish.

I want to learn to start taking care of myself better, by eating a healthier diet and taking more breaks. This includes breaks for exercising and for also cooking. I think I would add being more gentle with myself mentally. Learning to give myself the benefit of the doubt and not shaming myself for not understanding right away how to do something, is something I would personally add to the _SuperLearner_ article.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
I learned about numerics/ numbers which include ints (whole numbers) and floats (decimals).
I learned about strings which are just a sequence of characters.
I also learned about booleans which are like on/off switches and only have two states, true or false.

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?
 You would type `console.log("Hello World!");`

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?
// & /* */ are the characters used to indicate comments in a JavaScript file. The purpose of a code comment is to clarify
and provide context to what your code does for future developers, which can include yourself.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
A variable is like a box. You can write a name for the box and put different things, depending on the boxes shapes.
Some of the shapes used in computer science can hold booleans, numbers, and strings.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?
firstName, lastName, and creditCardInfo. I think they would all probably use the string data type to hold that info

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
Concatenation is the smashing together of one or more strings/ variables to make a larger concatenation or concoction of those
smaller string pieces.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?
I think developers often use concatenation on AirBnB or Facebook after you've signed in as a greeting.

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
What are some common issues that people run into with string interpolation? Also why do you have to use only backticks for String
interpolation?
