## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
  - **The list tells you to take care of your brain. I believe I eat healthy and try to keep my mind sharp. I want to start taking more breaks. I get into a habit of doing things for extended periods of time if I feel excited about them.**
2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
  - **I learned about strings, which are like plain text. We talked about booleans which are true of false. We also learned about numbers, which are just plain numbers**

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?
  - **console.log("Hello World!")**
4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?
  - **I would use // to create a comment in JavaScript. The purpose is to add text to the text editor that won't be processed by your computer.**
5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
  - **It's something that holds a value on a computer.**
6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?
  - **On any shopping website your total price is a variable, that is a combination of prices associated with the items you're purchasing**
7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
  - **It's combining strings and variables to create a new string**
8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?
  - **Websites will use concatenation when they say "Welcome, ..." where the dots would be replaced with a variable including your name**
9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
  - **Why would we use concatenation over interpolation?**
