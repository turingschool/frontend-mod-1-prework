## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?  

It is resonates with me in often taking breaks and taking care of my brain to take care of by slowing decline process.I will start reading more books and materials to have better understanding of my career and learning new techniques and approaches. Become more professional of my work and continue evaluating my skills more with new codes into my work process. Everything on SuperLearner Article was given good points which does not give me add anything on the list.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

There is three common and fundamental data types.

1 - String. You can write data types by using any kind of letters, characters by wrapping them in quotes.

Example below for string:

 var itemName = "Sweatshirt"
 var dogsName = "Henry"

2 - Number. Is data type which handles all types of numbers, wether it is float, decimals, or large number with comma or without.

Example for number:

var numberOFFlowers = 35
var sausageWeight = 45.5

3 - Boolean: We use boolean data types for determine is certain things in javascript script before running it or code.

Example for boolean:

var statement = "dog === cat"
-- should say false, because dog is not exact same as a cat.
 var number = 55 === 55
 -- should say true, because 55 and 55 exact same.

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

var greetings = "Hello World"
console.log(greetings)

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

Purpose of code comment to explain and show what your code does. Other person who has access to pull your work will be able to see what certain code parts do and better to manage and organise.
There are multi line comments, that you can use if your comment more tan one line and can contain more complex information.
Comment line starts with /* and comments you are going to write in it, and ends with same */.
And there are single line comments that start with // and you can write short comment, and does not need adding ending.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

If i have to explain to 5 year old kid what is variable i would explain it this way:
Imagine Tree, and its your variable, and if we think about tree we, can give it name appleTree and if we think what fruit it gives us, it is assignment operator and apple fruit is a value of the tree.
 variable (tree), name (appleTree),  = assignment operator (fruit), value (apples).


6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

Boolean data types and String.

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

Concatenation is the term stands for " we join together "
if you are want to join multiple strings together you do it with using (+) by adding your strings together, and we use it on purposes to create complete sentence. But how it works? it is result of _type coercion_ is helping us to covert to different data types in string so we can combine them together.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?

Chase app always greets with my name "Hello Farangiz" and its uses concatenation.


9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
None!
