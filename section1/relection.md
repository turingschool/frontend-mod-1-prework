## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

The overarching takeaway for me was the need to slow down a little bit. Everything takes time and focus. I'm not a huge reader because I feel like there must be ways to get the information in smaller bite size pieces. I've always been the person to look at the glossary or the dictionary to find the information that I need and move on, but I think I am missing the bigger picture. Of the six habits of a super learner, I am strong in three and three I would like to improve on.

- I will find information I need/want to know and make sure that the resource resonates with me. If I don't connect with it, there is another blog, news outlet, book that will speak to me.

- Learning is a **process**. Processes take time. Don't force it, just be open, willing, hard-working, and allow the information to settle in. I will celebrate the small wins.

- I have a **growth** mindset, but I'll be honest I was very scared to start the program. I now feel excited to learn and know that I am in control.

- I tend to **teach** others what I know, so this should be an easy process to continue following.

- I eat very healthy and take care of my brain. I would like to make sure that I am at the very least getting outside for a walk/jog for 20 minutes a day to support my mental and physical well-being. Gotta get that vitamin D!

- **Spaced learning** and breaks help retention. My plan is to take a look at my schedule and see how I can space out different types of information. New information vs. old information. Planning vs. coding. Memorization vs. application. Moving around or doing a task that requires less thought to give a little mental break. I feel like Turing keeps these processes in mind, so I'm excited to follow the guidance provided and create or mimic new healthy methods.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

- Boolean - a Boolean results in a true or false only. Used in 'for loops' and 'if statements'. This is something that I am planning to research more but I know it will come up. Specific rules regarding Booleans resulting in a true output (unless specified) are:

```'a' < 'p'

3 === '3' /* ignores datatype*/
3 == '3' // false

'2' > '1'
```

- Number - includes all **number, decimals, negatives, and fractions(not technically, but it works)**. No commas.

- String - consists of **letters, numbers, and other characters in QUOTES (emojis too).**  

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

```
console.log('Hello World!');
```

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

/// This is used for single line comments.

/* This is used for multiline comments. The purpose is to deactivate a portion of code in order to execute it without that portion. Or to leave comments for yourself or another member of your team. Ideally the code explains itself, but if that isn't the case then this is a great option! */

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

A variable has a name and a value. We can name our variable anything that we want, but it should explain the value. For example if the value is 'John' then the variable name could be 'name'. When you are declaring a variable, you always need to put var, let, or const before it. Declaring a variable looks like this.

```
var name = 'John';
```

The = `=` is the operator. Also, variables can change or vary.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

Spotify -
userName and password - 'string'
likeSong - Boolean resulting in true
play - Boolean resulting in true
pause - Boolean resulting in false

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

Concatention is the joining together of strings using the `+` operator.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?

Every site that has user accounts will likely use this function. Let's take Amazon for example, when you are not logged in, it says 'Hello', however when you log in, it says 'Hello, Nina'.

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)

I didn't quite grasp the sheep pseudocode exercise. I didn't know where to get started. Is there a more specific list of questions to ask yourself when attempting to define a goal and write out the steps in pseudocode?

Next time I may do a flowchart to try to understand the process better, but any insight would be appreciated.
