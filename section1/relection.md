## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
-This article helped me understand that learning is not all about the end goal.  It is a process in which you
change the way you learn.  More importantly it is how you get there and understanding how you learn and
process new information.  I will add more short breaks to my studying as I tend to study for long periods of time
without a break.  

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

-I learned the 3 data types string, number and boolean.  Strings are just letters and characters.  They are
always wrapped in single or double quotes.  Numbers are just any numbers.  Whole numbers, negatives or fractions all count as numbers.  Booleans are either true or false values.

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?
 -console.log("Hello World");

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?
-// Double forward slashes indicates a comment in JS.  Or /* comments */ would also work.  Comments tell the user
some information or comments about the code.  It makes it easier to figure out what the code is supposed to do.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
-A variable is a keyword that stores data value.  It is like a box you can label and store things in for later use

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?
-Reddit.  Username and password would be two variables that contain strings.  There's a night mode you can turn on or off.  This is likely a variable that holds a boolean.  There is a thing called karma which would hold a number value.

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
- If there are multiple variables with strings you can combine, or concatenate the strings together.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?
-Amazon.  When amazon tells you people who bought (this item) and (this item) also have purchased (this item)

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
-Why is concatenation still used when interpolation seems shorter and easier to read?  Rather than having to use a lot of double quotes after inserting every variable it seems more efficient to add the variable directly in the string
