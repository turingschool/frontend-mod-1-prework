## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

* Does the SuperLearner Article Resonate with me? **_Yes, it reinforced many things that I and stressed the importance of each item. As I went on my dog walk last night, I tried to recall each item and think about how I could incorporate them into my way of doing things._**
* What do you want to do more of? **_I do almost all of these items in some manner or another. First off, I think the biggest thing I can do is be intentional about each area rather than doing them passively. Second, I'd like to make time to read the book mentioned "Genius: The life & science of Richard Feynman". And finally, I do want to take more time to ensure I retain what I'm learning by reviewing, recalling, sharing or writing items down.")_**
* Would I add anything to the list? **_I would add "lean by doing". What I mean is that I learn best by the act of doing/taking action. That's not always possible but where there is an opportunity to take a hands on approach I think that's a really valuable learning opportunity and skill._**

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

- **_String_** is text. Example is "hello" or 'hello' (don't forget the quotations, please).
- **_Integer_** is a whole number (positive or negative). Example is 10, 0, or -25.
- **_Float_** is a number with decimals (positive or negative). Example is 5.5 or -0.001.
- **_Boolean_** is a true or false value/indicator. An example is a conditional statement such as if x >= 5.
- **_Array_** is a collection of values. Example is formated as such [26,24,27] or ["a","b","c"]. It's best to have one data type within an array for coding simplicity (meaning to be able to manage/work with the values in an array) although it is possible to have multiple data types.
- **_Extension_** is data where pairing or coupling information is important. An example is as follows { "9th grade": 110, "10th grade": 125, "11th grade": 66, "12th grade": 70}. It's important in this instance to pair the grade (9th with the room of 110. Another example is { "Mod 0": "Tim and David", "Mod 1": "Mike and Sal", "Mod 2": "Brittany and Robbie" }

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

* console.log("Hello World!")

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

* The purpose of code comment is to allow for further explanation for your future self or other programmers.
* There are two character options:
* For a single line comment start with //. JS will ignore the text thereafter.
* For multi-line comments start with /* and end with */. JS will ignore the text between these characters.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

* A variable is used to store and re-use values throughout a program. Use of a variable reduces code redundancy and in the bigger picture allows a script to process a significant amount or flexible amount of input/output.
* How would I explain a variable to a 5 year old? I'd have to think about it but I'd try to find something they use all the time... a common object that is used like a variable. For example, I might explain that a variable is like a book shelf or a dinner plate or a hanger in your closet. If I stay with the hanger example, I'd explain that you can hang a jacket or a shirt or a pair of pants on the hanger to store it. Let's say you put your jacket on the hanger when you go home tonight. Then the hanger holds the jacket until you need it again. Say when you go out to walk the dog. When you take the jacket you might put a shirt on the hanger, and later you can go get the shirt to wear... say... to school today.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

* I commonly use amazon.com to purchase items. Three variables amazon likely uses are listed below.
* var userName = "Steve"; //string
* var shippingAddress = "1234 Fake Street, Anytown, Anycity, Anyzip"; //string althogh it's likely they break the shipping address into shippingStreet, shippingCity, shippingCity, shippingZip and more
* var mostRecentPurchase = ["item#1","item#2"]; //array to track purchases

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

* Concatenation is joining together various bits of information into a string.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?

* I'll stick with the amazon.com example. Assuming I'm logged in, the developers likely used concatention to list my name with the string "Hello" to welcome me to the site as (var welcomeLogin = "Hello " + userName)in the upper right corner. Since this is a repeatable action for all logged in users, it seems like they should establish a reassignment action that reuses code to insert my user name along with any leading or trailing information.

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)

* None at this time.
