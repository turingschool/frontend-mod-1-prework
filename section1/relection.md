## Section 1 Reflection

### 1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
Because I have worked as an educator for the last 8 years, this resonated with me as tips I give my students as well as methods I have injected into my lesson planning. Now that I am flipping my role from teacher to student in the Turing program, I am having to rewire my brain a bit. I am no longer helping student take breaks, facilitating moments for them to teach one another, or building in class time for students to read more. Now, I am having to remind myself to do these things MYSELF. I would add to this list that "Super Learners" have a solutions oriented mindset. It has been incredibly important in my life to approach problems and set backs not as "failures" but as opportunities to learn and grow as I seek solutions.

###2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
-by using 'console.log()' I can tell the console to output and run the defined information to the user
-Variables - this command assigns a value to a variable name
-Variable names are short but descriptive of the assigned value; they cannot begin with numbers nor contain dashes or periods. They can contain numbers and should follow camelCase
-Concatenation- This joins together variables into a String
-Interpolation- This injects values into a string

### 3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?
var greeting = "Hello World!";

console.log(greeting);

### 4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?
 // are used to indicate comments in a JavaScript file. The purpose of a code comment is to indicate the intentions of a code or to make notes of the purpose of a code

### 5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
A variable is a way to capture a value. The value can be captured using a short yet descriptive variable name that can be used to create strings, manipulate the value, and be reassigned (if desired).

### 6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?
Frequently used app: Instagram
Types of variables:
-1. username: Displays the user's profile information as a string  
-2. numberOfLikes: Interpolate a running count of likes from other users  
-3. followers: Interpolate a running count of users following an account

### 7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
Concatenation is when one or more variables are joined together in a string.

### 8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?
When I login to a website and it says "Hello, Renee". It concatenated my username to the end of the greeting "Hello".

### 9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
I'm trying to think of times it is better to concatenate vs. interpolate. Interpolate seems to be useful when the values of variables are fluid and changing often and concatenation seems to lend itself well to more stagnant variables. I'm wondering if that is a correct, initial comparison of those two data types.
