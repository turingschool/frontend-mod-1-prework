## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
I think what resonated with me the most was taking more breaks while trying to learn new information. I want to try my best to have focused learning for 30-50 minutes at a time and then taking a break like suggested, so I don't overwhelm myself. Something I already do especially this past year was trying to read as many books as I could for a goal I set for  myself. I hope that even with starting a new program, I can try to continue the habit of reading a good book.
2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
The three data types I learned about in this section are numbers, strings, and booleans. Numbers is a data type which handles numbers such as 47. A string can consist of letters and other characters, all wrapped within quotes. A boolean evaluates data to either be true or false statements. For example, if a username and password that is typed in match what is in the database.
3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?
console.log("Hello World!")
4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?
You can either use // then write out the comment or do /* words */ ; the purpose of a code comment is to tell the reader/coder what the code is doing or a description of how the script works.
5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
A variable is whatever you declare it to be. I would explain that a variable could be anything; the coder has to assign it to something and give it meaning. For example var food = hot wings I assigned my variable to be a food item and that food item is hot wings.
6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?
The play store is an app that uses variables like number of installations, reviews, and ratings. Installations and ratings would probably consist of using numbers as a data type, and reviews could consist of strings.
7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
Concatenation is a way to join things together with a + symbol.
8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?
I'm thinking of a video game where developers might use concatention when the game asks for your name, and then as you play the game characters will say Hello "Rachel" because you have made it as the input.
9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
My question is pertaining to re-assignment of a variable. I wrote the definition as overriding an initial value given, but I do not understand the purpose of why I guess. Hopefully the question I'm trying to ask makes sense.
