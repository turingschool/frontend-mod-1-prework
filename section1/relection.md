## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

The article resonated with me on many levels. I have read various articles about learning throughout my adult life, and all of these things have been suggested at one point or another, but I don't think I've seen them put all together into a basic plan to facilitate deep learning.
I have not always had a growth mindset. It was only after a talk at Tedx Boulder about growing over changing yourself that I was steered into the positive growth mindset. It's something I have exhibited throughout my life at different times, but I never viewed it as a mindset, so I was never consistent. The growth mindset has changed my life, as I am here at Turing because of it. After a first interview did not result in an offer to enroll, I set out to conquer the logic game section until I felt confident that I understood it.
I have not been practicing the short breaks as I should. I've noticed a marked difference in my attention and desire to continue after having adding a Pomodoro timer application.
The section about taking care of your brain seems obvious, but I think it's easy to overlook. I was immediately excited about paying attention to my brain health, and have started paying attention to a healthy brain diet.
If I could add to the list, I would definitely mention the importance of good sleep habits. I value sleep more as a 39 year old than at any other time in my life. If I feel the need for a nap, I try and take a short one. I'm an early riser, and that feels healthy to me. I wakeup every day around 04:30 - my cats are demanding - and I'm usually in bed by 21:00 at latest. That's a solid 7.5 hours of adult sleep and that is when I feel at my best.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

We learned about three data types: numbers, strings, and Booleans

Numbers used 0-9 and no commas. One thousand and thirty-seven would be written 1037. Numbers can also be decimals, using a 0 before the decimal for numbers less that one. One-fourth would be written as 0.25

Strings are a data type consisting of letters and other characters like a comma, or exclamation point. The string is held in quotation marks, either double OR single, but the opening and closing quote must match. You cannot have a string that starts with a single quote and ends in a double quote or vice versa.

Boolean is a data that evaluates to either true or false.

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

First declare the variable and store the info "Hello World!". Since the info seems to be a greeting, I will name the variable "greeting", use the = assignment operator, and store the info "Hello World!". Finally, we ask the console to log the info for the variable "greeting".
var greeting = "Hello World!";
console.log(greeting);

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

One line comments preceded by //
Multiple line comments preceded by /* and conclude with */
Comments are used to make notes about your code, what it does, and which make your code easier to read and help others and yourself understand your code, or it could indicate that changes may need to be made to the code in the future.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

A variable is a piece of information that can "vary" or change. A variable represents a number or other kinds of data that is subject to change.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

Food delivery apps like Grubhub and DoorDash would probably have:  
A variable for pickup or delivery holding Boolean data true or false
A variable for item count which would hold numbers
A variable for displaying a greeting that would hold a string such as "Good Afternoon!"

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

Concatenation is when the value of a variable is some combination of other variables and potentially new information.
For example: var one = 1; var two = 2; var total = one + two;
console.log(total); would result in the console logging 3.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?

Using a site like CodeAcademy, having a profile set up and working through the lessons will activate little notifications that congratulate the user by name for working through lessons x-amount of days in a row which I think would be an example of concatenation.

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)

How is Boolean data used more specifically? Obviously the true or false info is not what you probably want the user to see, so I would like to understand better how it's used. Is Boolean data used only in JavaScript?
