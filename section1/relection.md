## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
- This link was not working.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
-  We learned about "primitive" data typesS
   - string: A data type made up of letters and/or characters. Can be used with text,
   numbers, emojis, or special characters.  It is wrapped in single or double quotes.
   - number: A data type incorporating all numbers, positive, negative, and decimals.
   - boolean: A data type that evaluates true or false.

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?
- ```JavaScript
   console.log("Hello World");```

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?
// or /*  The purpose of a code comment is to be explicit about your intentions or rationale.
 Or when working with another's code, to leave collaborative notes.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
- A variable is ONE thing. It can be almost anything, your mom, your dog, the name of your favorite movie.
And you can give this ONE thing a nickname - maybe your favorite movie's name is too long so you call it favMovie. Or your mom's whole name can just be shortened into myMom. Now, whenever you
want to use that word or words - you can just use your shortcut nickname.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?
- NYT Cooking. I bet they use var author, var featured, var healthy.

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
- Concatenation is a VERY long word to say "join". It is a tool to join data types (even different data types) together and coercing them into one string.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?
- On Reddit, I imagine developers use concatenation to show "Posted by + userName + timeFromOriginal Post"

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
- Right now I cannot IMAGINE when i will use % the modulo to code something. That is exciting to consider. I also do not feel close to 100% on the distinctions and pitfalls of using different comparisons. I would also like to understand - what is a situation where you would HAVE to use concatenation over interpolation?
