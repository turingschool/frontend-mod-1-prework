## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

The over all message of the article resonated with me because it was a message of positivity and encouragement as well as helpful facts and tips to succeed at learning a new skill.
I already read a lot but it is a combination of technical reading as well as reading for fun. I also already view learning as a journey and not just a destination. Learning takes time and as nice as it would be to download new knowledge like Neo from The Matrix, that's just not how learning works!
I would like to try and get myself to take more breaks. Sometimes, times seems to get away from me and I don't realize how long I have spent sitting at my computer.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
I learned about:
- Strings: Which are letters and other characters wrapped in quotation marks. Example: "This is a string!"
- Integers: Which are numbers, that can also include negative numbers and decimals. Example: -1, 0, 1, 1.5
- Booleans: Which represent true or false values. Example: 1 < 2 true, 1 > 2 false.

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

console.log("Hello World!");

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

You would use either /* */ or // to indicate comments in a JavaScript file.
Code comments allow developers to explain why they added a line of code.
It also allows developers who did not originally create the code to understand why a line of code was created.
Code comments can also be used to block a line of code and prevent it from being acknowledged by the program.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

A variable is where you store information.
In kindergarten everyone gets their own coat cubby. Each coat cubby is labeled with each child's unique name. In the cubby only that child's items can be stored.  

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

Account information:
Name as a data string. var firstName = NAME;
Password as  boolean (password must match in order to log in)
number of followers on social media as an integer. var followerCount = 0

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

A concatenation allows developers to combine data types and declared variables into one chunk of information.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?

They use concatenation when a user inputs personal data into the site such as when someone signs into their account from the main site page, the site then begins to use the user's personal name instead of a generic greeting.

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)

Is there a limit to how many variables/ data types can be added together in a concatenation or interpolation before it becomes too messy and unclear what exactly is happening?
