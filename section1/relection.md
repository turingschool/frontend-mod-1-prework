## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

*This article was very eye opening to read and gave a lot of good advice. I currently like to read, however, I would like to read more. I usually read a lot in a short period of time, and then take a break, and then get back into it. I would like to be more consistent. I also like to take short breaks. I think  it is very important in order to stay focused and keep your mind fresh. I really liked the "view learning as a process" habit as that is something I have never thought of. I need to start thinking of learning as a journey and not as a destination because you can learn forever. It doesn't ever end.*

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

*I learned 3 data types in this section. Number, String, and Boolean. The Number data type holds all numbers including positive, negative, and also decimals. Large numbers do not have commas. The String data type contains letters, and other characters including emojis and special characters. A string is wrapped in quotes either single or double. Whichever you choose you must do for both the beginning and end. The Boolean data type evaluates a true or false statement. it helps the computer determine which script to run.*

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

`console.log("Hello World!")`

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

*The code comment adds information for other devs to see. It explains what your code does. You use the (/) before and after your text for multiple line comment and you use (//) before your text for a single line comment*

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

*A variable stores a value in the computer. These values can change and be used later on. For example, if we were playing a basketball game, the score would be a variable. Every time someone scores points, the variable will change*

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

*I am a walker/sitter for Rover. Three variables that it holds are name, price, backyard. The name variable would be a string, the price variable is a number, the backyard variable is a Boolean.*

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

*Concatenation is when you join multiple strings together. You use the (+) operator to do this.*

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?

*Using the same Rover app example, I think the developers would use concatention when the client books a dog walker. A notification is sent to the dog walker saying "${name} requests you to walk ${petName} on ${date}"*

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)

*I would like real life examples of when you would do interpolation instead of concatenation and vice versa.*
