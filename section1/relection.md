## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

The SuperLearner Article made a lot of sense regarding how we process information and retain it. I am currently eating healthy brain food that supports processing and storing information. I also believe in growth and there is always more to learn and this is exciting! I need to push myself to read more and make sure I take breaks throughout the day. I would add getting adequate sleep to promote these functions as well!  

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

The data types learned in this section include:
Strings - These are letters or characters wrapped in ""
Numbers - These are numerical values including negatives and decimals (floating point number)
Boolean - This is a true or false statement and will always produce 'true' or 'false'

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

console.log("Hello World!")

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

You would use either // // or */ /* to insert comments on a line or lines of code. This allows us to add information for other developers in our code to help instruct them on how to read it/ manipulate/ run it.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

A variable is basically a nickname that we assign meaning to. This nickname allows us to keep the meaning assigned short and easily found.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

BBC News app:
var articleName = "Why Utah is making men pay women's pregnancy costs" String data type
var isPulblishedToday = true    Boolean
var subCategory = "Video"  string data type

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

This is the process of joining strings using the defined variable names and the "+" symbol to create one large string

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?

BBC News - to compile information about the article such as the content, sources, related topics/stories

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
Answering these real app questions is prompting me to ask how these specific data types are used in the real world. How would concatenation and interpolation be used in an actual app? Is this just to help truncate code and allow developers to write more quickly?
