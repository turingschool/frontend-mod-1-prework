## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

I read constantly and I definitely understand that learning is a process and we're building on little victories all the time. I'm getting used to the pom system in particular, and spacing out work as needed in general.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
strings can be Anything
boolean values are logical true/false or greater than/less than/equal to
numbers are integers, decimels, or unreal numbers like negatives

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?
var str = "Hello World!"
console.log(str)

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?
Double backslashes or "//"

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
A variable is a data point. To a 5 year old: "It's something we can say about the thing we're working on"

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

Letterboxd:

loggedIn - true/false
moviesLoggedThisYear - number
userName - string

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

The joining together of strings of data in console.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?
In joining smaller lists of films together to form larger ones when you move from criterion like title to country of origin

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)

Little unsure about how to integrate boolean values into the others grammatically.
