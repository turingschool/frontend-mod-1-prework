## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

I like teaching and helping my other classmates with the homework, and I also have a strong growth mindset. I would like to read more and get better at break-taking. I would add to this, "Always work one step at a time. Don't think of a new goal as daunting, just do the next step."

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

Number - denotes a numerical value. Can be 0, pos/neg, or a decimal.

String - phrases - Letters and other characters wrapped within '' or ""

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

`console.log("Hello World!");`

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

// before the comment text. The purpose is so that programmers other than the creator of the code can see what they were trying to do, what problems they ran into, etc.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

A changeable value. The calendar date is a variable. It changes every day.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

Reddit probably uses a variable for the page number (number), thumbs up (number/string), and homepage algorithm (string).

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

Concatenation is like adding variables in between strings, to log a complete string.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?

Facebook. "What's on your mind, Eric?"

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)

I'm wondering if the syntax for the non-code answers was correct for my exercises. I entered them using the // notes format.

Just to confirm, when you make multiple file changes, you should add and commit them separately, right? I believe mod 0 session 3 I made a mistake in putting a file add and adding text in  one commit.
