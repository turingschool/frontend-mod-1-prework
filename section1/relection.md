## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

while i was reading it i realized that i already do some of the habits as is. i usually try to teach others thing that i learned. it helps me remember what i was taught. also after starting a turing i got into the habit of taking breaks every 30 minutes or so. i feel like i should treat my brain better by eating healthier foods. i usually don't eat the healthiest of foods and there are times i forget small but important details

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
  1) string- are snetences with any characters with "" or '' around them
  2) number- can be either float or integer with there being no commas on bigger numbers
  3)boolean- is either true or false

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

console.log("Hello World!");

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?
// - is for one line comment. /* ~~ */ is for 2 or more line comments. they are used to give additional information that only programmers can see

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
it is a name that you give to information

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?
for social media the name displayed is Var name and it changes if you change your username.
changing someones mood could be var mood = happy. if they change it then the mood gets reassigned
displaying where they work/worked

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
is when you combine a string and variables to create a unique string.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?
when someone shares something on facebook there could be a post that some shares. to show friends it was shared the code could be
var name = "dustin";

console.log(name + " has shared a post");

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
when you re-assign variable, is the original assignment gone and the only way to go back is to so another re-assignment
