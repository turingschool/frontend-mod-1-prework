## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

*The SuperLearner article is very interesting and a great way of having awareness of how to do better. I have never seen myself as someone like that, but I definitely can resonate with a lot of the characteristics ,for example: 
- Super learners view learning as a process,
- They adopt a growth mindset,
- Super learners teach others what they know,
- Effective learners take care of their brains,
- They take short breaks, early and often,
*What I still have to improve is reading, I think Turing has already been a big part of this learning process, hostly I feel lost sometimes with so many options and so little time to be able to read all of it. I neede to be better with my eating too, I usually am very responsible, but covid time put me in a different mindset, having to deal with the depressive part of being locked inside the house made me eat a little more sweets.  

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

*Data Types Session one mod 1 prework: 
* String - between quotes, can be single or double quotes but you have to match, you will have to finish with the same one you have started.
* Number - it is with numbers, can be calculation of numbers as well.
* Boolean - Has one or two values : True or False. 
 

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

 *$ console.log("Hello World!")*

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

*I would use // ate the beginning of the line, for a single line comment or would use /* at the begging and after finish writing the comment */ for more than one line comment. Code comment is very useful whe you have to go back to a project after a long time or if another person will have to fix a Bug, or add more lines to the code, or just to understand what is written there without having to guess. It is a time saving practice for software engineers and saving money practice for the companies.* 

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

*Variable is a name we gave to a value. Variables can be defined using var keyword.Variables must be initialized before using.Multiple variables can be defined in a single line. It can store value of any data type through out it's life time. to a 5 years old I would say : A Variable can be like a box you put something inside, if you want to put anything else you will have to remove what was inside to put the other item there.* 

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

*Facebook app- var firstName, var lastName, var age. Those variables holds the personal information data of each person who have an account within this app.*


7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

*Concatenation is a way in Javascript that the computer can join together variables in the same console.log, the console will read all together in the same line, as one.*

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?

*I will use the same example Facebook, they use concatenation when they show the user profile, at the profile page.*

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)

* I actually have a lot of questions... but I will choose just a feel: 
* - How obvious it is when you see together a Interpolation, a concatenation, an array, an object and a variable with interpolation? 
* - When we put all the variables together , usually it is all mixed or more like a block of coding with strings, a box with numbers, a box with boolenans, etc?
* -How complex is boolean in real life ?
