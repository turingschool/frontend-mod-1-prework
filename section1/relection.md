## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
* I was most intrigued by the idea that Super Learners view learning as a process or a journey without a destination. I've done a lot of learning in schools with definitive end dates and graduations, and I've always considered those dates as the end of the road for learning. Now looking back, I think that I could argue that in a lot of those fields I learned the most after I had left those schools.

* If there was anything on this list that I feel I could really claim, I think it would be the growth mindset. I was unfamiliar with this term until I started at Turing, but I've always somewhat prided myself in trying new things and sticking with them. I have a genuine interest in branching out to new forms of the things that I like, and trying things that I have no experience with.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
* I learned about:
  1. Strings
  2. Numbers
  3. Boolean

**Strings** are data that the computer reads as plain text rather than a function, operation or command. They can consist of any letters, characters, or numbers, as long as they are entered between quotation marks.

**Numbers** are integers and floats. They are a numerical value that can be either positive or negative and can be whole numbers or numbers with decimals. They do not require quotations like strings, but you should not use commas in numbers with more than 4 digits.

**Boolean** data are true or false statements. I like to think of them as a question asking *yes* or *no*. They will always be entered in as *true* or *false*, and they also do not require quotations.


3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?
```console.log('"Hello World!"');
```

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?
* A code comment would begin with two slashes like this:

```// This is a code comment.
```

* A code comment is useful for adding notes into code for yourself or other programmers that the computer will ignore. They can also be used to make the computer ignore parts of the code temporarily when necessary.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
* A Variable is basically naming a value. This is really helpful when the value that you want to name is very complicated and would be annoying to have to retype every time that you would need to use it.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?
* I use reddit a lot, and I assume that when I sign in, reddit uses a boolean variable to decide if my password matches the password for my account and I should be allowed access.

* A number data variable would be used to count the amount of upvotes a post or comment has.

* Strings are probably used all over the place on reddit to display subreddit names, usernames, post titles, and a million more.

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
* Concatenation is when you combine several different values together to make a string. You can tie together strings and numbers to make a string because of type coercion.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?
* Reddit often sends messages to a user with about the upvotes on their post or comments. It usually reads something like "Hello _username, your post has reached 50 upvotes!" In this scenario, the bot is probably concatenating the username pulled from a variable, the number of upvotes pulled from a booleean value, and the rest of the message is filled in with strings.

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
* I'm certain this is part of the course somewhere in the future, but using the terminal seems clumsy for anything except for git. I know we're supposed to be good typers, and this isn't supposed to be an issue, but it seems like a lot can go wrong when you're using it the terminal. So I guess my question is what is so helpful about using the terminal rather than some other method? I'm sure this is due to inexperience, and I'll learn more about it as we go through the course.
