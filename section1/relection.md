## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
- Super learners teach others what they know. Trying to teach someone else what you've learned will help you retain information and find holes in your knowledge. This is something I try to do but I didn't realize in the process of helping others I'm helping myself.
- I will try not to go on a learning spree without recalling, sharing, and/or writing down key ideas.
- Must take care of brain health to learn optimally.
- Take a short break early and often. 30-50 minute sessions, take breaks between sessions to retain and process information.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
- We covered strings which are a collection of alphabetical characters, numbers, and special characters.
- We covered booleans which give a value of true or false
- We covered numbers which are integers.

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?
- console.log("Hello World!");

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?
- // for single line and /* */ for multi-line comments.
- you use comments to explain your code. It makes it easier to read and understand.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
- A variable is a place to store a value.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?
- In slack, we probably have a userName variable, a whatIDo variable, and a phoneNumber variable on all of our profiles. These are all strings.

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
- It's the combination of variables and data types that can be logged together.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?
- On the playstation network it shows you when the last time your friends were online. An example under the hood might look like userName + " was last online " + date + " " + time and display as "Andrew2000 was last online 3/3/20 9:30pm"

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
- How is this work reviewed/graded? Is perfection expected?
