## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

The SuperLearner Article definitely resonated with me. The things from the list had just started doing were to take short and often breaks. I like to set my timer for 25 mins (especially when I'm having a hard time focusing) and just focus on my work. This helps me stay on track and sets myself up to not be as distracted. I have also always viewed learning as a process, not a destination. I am always working on learning new things and different skillsets- like coding!

I would like to read more often and read with more intention. In a world where there is technology and access to information at your fingertips all the time I can find myself mostly reading useless information off my phone. When I am more intentionally reading, like a book or whole articles, I find my attention span is better and I retain a lot more information and I am calmer.  I would also like to be better at taking care of my brain by what I eat/drink. Mostly drink a lot less coffee and more water! But I am excited to explore new diets that encourage my brain to be healthy.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

Each datatype was new to me (prior to this program)
String = a data type that represents a text
integer/float = data type of a whole number (integer) or with a decimal (float)
boolean = data type that is either true or false

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?
`console.log("Hello World");`

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

There are two ways to indicate comments in JS. If you only need one line you can use // if you want to do a longer paragraph you can use /* ...*/

The code comment is useful for explaining what the code is doing. The code comment is not run by the computer and is only shown in the code side. You can also use it to deactivate a part of a code.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

A variable represents the data stored. For example when you assign a variable a datatype it is essentially saying this is what this is. If the variable is age the value is 5 and when you turn 6 the value is now 6.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

Site: Gmail.com
variables:
1. email and the data type is string
2. Password and that datatype is string and boolean (true if correct, false if wrong)
3. Age and data type integer

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

Concatenation is when you join datatypes together with a string to produce a full sentence.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?

In gmail and it says "Hello, Hayley today is Tuesday" it is using concatenation with the variables being Hayley and Tuesday. The string being "hello," "today is"

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
I am having issues getting the node to run on terminal. I used the console on chrome to run the code to make sure it worked.

My other question is when would someone use concatenation instead of interpolation. Interpolation seems more logical, concise and easy to read/type.
