## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
I already read a lot, view learning as a process, and teach others what I know. I want to start taking better care of my brain as well as adopting the pom breaks.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
Strings are any kind of text wrapped in quotation marks.
Number data types involve any number
Boolean data types evaluates data to "true" or "false"

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?
console.log('Hello World!');

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?
To indicate a comment, you use "//". The purpose of code commenting is to give a clear description of what a particular bit of coding is accomplishing

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
A variable is a value that can be re-used in multiple places

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?
When I log onto Reddit, they compare my username and password (as string variables) to what's saved on their servers to see if it matches. If it does match, then they allow me to access my account (boolean). If not, I'm told the username and password don't match.

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
Concatenation is joining together different variables together

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?
I think that any site that has specific user accounts uses strings and boolean variables concatenated together to figure out if the owner of the account is logging on.

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
I'm still not quite clear on what console.log does. Is it used to run an entire program? or only certain lines? is it used in published programs or is it only for debugging or trying things out?
