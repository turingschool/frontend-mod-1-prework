## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

The Superlearners article made me realize that there is more that I can be doing to become a better, more efficient learner. One of the things that stood out to me was the part about eating foods that have anti brain aging properties. Since reading this article I have researched some of these foods and started implementing them into my diet. I am good at making myself take short breaks when I feel my productivity staring to slip or my brain start to fog, they help me to refocus on work and come back with a better mindset.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.'

Number is a data type that can be broken up into two data types, integers and floats. An integer is made of of whole numbers where as a float is a number containing a decimal point. A string is a data type that holds any characters including numbers and special characters. everthing that you want to be a string needs to be surrounded in quotation marks. Boolean is a data type that evaluates to either true or false. Something like "is the store open?" can be evaluated using the boolean data type.

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

console.log ("Hello World!");

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

// <--- These double slashes indicate the start of a comment. Code comments are helpful to yourself or other developers when trying to decipher what a piece of code is doing.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

A variable is a placeholder for different values. I would tell a 5 year old that a variable is a word or letter that can have whatever meaning you want it to have, as long as you specify what it means before hand.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

Thinking of a shopping app, one variable could be cart. The cart variable is an array of all items that you have added to the cart. A variable for price/sale price of items would likely be a float because it will have decimal points. lastly a userName variable would contain the string of the clients username.

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

concatination is when you use the + operator to combine multiple strings together.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?

Maybe like a greeting on a website where it adds your username to the greeting string. like "Hey " + userName + "check out deals for you on " + favoriteItem + "!"

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)

 I am a little confused about the key pair/value data type that we have talked about.
