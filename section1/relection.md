## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

  I found the article **super** _useful_, I already do some of those things, like reading a lot, my mindset is very adaptable too, I take good care of my brain naturally by following a keto diet filled with fuel for the brain, and teaching others as a way to learn it's been part of my life for many years, but the article still remanded me of this awesome tool and use it during my **Turing** program by helping others. But some others I wasn't practicing with full awareness.

  However, I have been understanding more and practicing seeing the learning as a process, seeing it as a path and not just something that I need to get done to move on. I've been also practicing taking frequent breaks during the time I've been working on Mod0 and Mod1 pre-work.

  It was an amazing reading to prepare myself to be successful at learning.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

  I learned about numbers, strings and booleans.
    *numbers, in JS this data type includes all numbers, enteral, decimal, and negative.
      The syntax for decimal numbers looks like this (0.25), big numbers are written without a coma, like this (3045).
    *strings, are letters and other characters wrapped within quotes ("") or ('').
    *booleans, type of data that evaluates to one of two values: true or false. And you can use many types of comparisons and equality sings to evaluate different elements.

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

```JavaScript
console.log("Hello World!");
```

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

  //You can use (//) for single line comments, and /* For multiple line comments */

  The purpose of comments in JS is to make your code more readable for other and yourself in the future, also explains hoe the script works and prevent certain part of your code to be read by the interpreter when testing your code.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

  A _variable_ is an element where we can store data in a script. To a 5 years old kid I would tell that it's like a box, where you can put different types of toys to use it on a later time.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

  I am thinking on **Ebay**, I think on the _name_ of a product like a **string**, the _price_ of the product like a **number** and for the price filters I would think that the interface gets information on the range price you're looking for, assign it to a variable (*min* and *max*) and then runs code to match your search within those parameters using **booleans**.

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

  Concatenation it's a programing term that means 'join together'. It's used to join strings together.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?

  *Google.com* when you make a spelling mistake in the search you want the site returns:
  >Showing results for [corrected search]
  >search instead of [non corrected search]

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)

  I'm sure there are questions but I still haven't gotten stuck on one to still have it, I've been solving the questions with the work I've been instructed to do, for example until 9 questions ago I had a lot of questions about **Markdown** language, but, i've been clearing it.
  The part that I considered more slippery it was the comparisons symbols and equalities operators, and the `null/undefined` evaluations. So I'm looking forward to get more practice with it to feel more confident.

  I do have more questions about the meaning and working mode of the libraries and many other things that I haven't been too exposed yet. But I think I'll get there eventually.
