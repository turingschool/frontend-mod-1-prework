## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

I really enjoyed that article. It resonated with me in the sense that I already do a lot of the items but I didn't realize they were traits of lifelong learners. The one thing that I would like to start doing is eating more brain healthy foods. I have really fallen into convenience foods lately. I also need to get better about taking breaks. I'll get too into a project and lose track of time.

One thing I would like to add would be along the same lines as the second point: "super learners view learning as a process". I think super learners are also focused on the process and not as worried about failure so much as the learning. I'd venture to say that they see mistakes as learning experiences.
This would be something else that I would like to work on for myself and cultivate in my own life. I have a hard time with my mistakes and worry about failure which has stopped me from trying more challenging things.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

- Number: any numbers including decimals and negatives.
- String: any textual data formatted in quotes, either single, double or backticks.
- Boolean: return of either true or false.


3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

console.log("Hello World!");

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

//for single line Comments
/*for multiple line comments
that you might want to include more information in.
Comments are helpful for you and other developers reading your code to have a better understanding of what the code does.*/

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

A variable is assigning temporary data to certain term that can reused through out the script and modified as needed.
It's assigning one name a certain value or meaning to be able to use that value in different areas of the code. And that meaning for that name can change as you need it to.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

I may be off base with this, but I'm thinking for the mindless game I play, Disney Emoji Blitz, they would use variables associated with the different emojis that you select (string), the prize you get depending on your score(number), and maybe even the choice to use power ups(boolean or string). I'm sure it is far more complex coding than what I understand at the moment though.


7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

Concatenation means to join multiple things together.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?

I would think any site that you input certain information, like your name and the response is personalized. Ex: 'Hello, Megan! Thank you for joining us today.'

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)

My biggest questions I have right now are more big picture and how all of this comes together. But I know we'll get to all of that.
I'm also curious, if interpolation is easier to read, what is the benefit of using concatenation instead?
How often are code comments added and is there specific information best to include?
