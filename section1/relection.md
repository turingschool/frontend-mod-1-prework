## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

This was much more my speed as the concepts involved were well explained, the exercises were relevant to the subject matter and the process was thought out and executed well on a timeline consistent with the provided study material.  My overall experience with this section was pleasant as a result and I got the idea and presented output that satisfied the criteria. I do already have a grasp on this list and want to start in with new commands.  Modulo operator was not on this list.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
Boolean - true or false only
Integer - a whole number
Float - a number or part of a number
String - In quotes and including numbers, characters, and letters
Arrays have not been addressed in Mod 1 prework

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

console.log("Hello World!")

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

A code comment allows future viewer, updater or even the user to determine any number of things about what is occurring with the given code, a memo about operations, or even a note to the creator.
If it were a single line, even after the code I would precede and indicate a code comment with
'//'.
However, if I wanted to embed it in a function or across several lines I would encase the comment with '/*'  and '*/'


5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

A variable is something that can change just like polyjuice potion.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

Metronome:
tempo or bpm (float)
timeSignature (float)
noteGetsBeat (integer)
measureLength (integer)


7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

Concatenation is when two different types of data can be strung together by a built in interface.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?

A piano learning app, when announcing a victory:
 "Great Job, " + firstName + ", You earned a " + points + " point bonus!"

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)

Ah ok what is the modulo operator I had to make something work there. Nevermind that for now, should I be using markdown in GitHub currently to edit this .md file instead of atom? And can I find a simpler way of running the node command from terminal than typing out the directory path everytime?
