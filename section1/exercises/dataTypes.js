  // expected output: Alan Turing

// EXAMPLE: Write code below to log `Welcome to Turing!` in the console:
console.log('Welcome to Turing!');
  // expected output: Welcome to Turing!

// YOU DO: Write code below to log `99 bottles of pop on the wall...`:

console.log(2 + 2);
  // expected ouput: 4

// EXAMPLE: log the result of 7 subtracted from 83 console:
console.log(83 - 7);
  // expected output: 76

// YOU DO: log the result of 6 multiplied by 53 to the console:
console.log(6 * 53);
  // expected output: 318

// YOU DO: log the result of 20 divided by 4 to console:
console.log(20 / 4);
  // expected output: 5

// YOU DO: log the result of the modulo of 10 into 54:
console.log(10 % 54);
  // expected output: 10

//-------------------
// BOOLEANS
//-------------------

// EXAMPLE: log to the console the result of 1 is equal to 2:
console.log(1 === 2);
  // expected output: false; 1 is not equal to 2

// EXAMPLE: log to the console the result of 7 is greater than 2:
console.log(7 > 2);
  // expected output: true; 7 is greater than 2

// YOU DO: log to the console the result of "hello" is equal to "Hello":
console.log("hello" === "Hello");
  // expected output: false; the lower cased "hello" has a greater index in JS
console.log("hello" > "Hello");
  // expected output: true

// YOU DO: log to the console the result of 3 is not equal to 4:
console.log(3 != 4);
  // expected output: true

// YOU DO: log to the console the result of 4 is less than or equal to 5:
console.log(4 <= 5);
  // expected output: true; 4 is less than 5, doesn't need to check the equal


//-------------------
// FINAL CHECK
//-------------------

// Did you run this file in your terminal to make sure everything printed out to the console
  // as you would expect? If you had issues with doing so, ask in your pre-work channel for
  // help ASAP.
  // Yes!  Everything worked out and looks correct, hooray!
