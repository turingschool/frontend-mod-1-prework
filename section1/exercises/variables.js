//
// In the exercises below, write your own code where indicated
// to achieve the desired result.
//
// A couple examples that are already completed. Your task is to complete
// any remaining prompt.
//
// When navigated to the root of this project directory, you should be able to run this
// file from your terminal with the command `node section1/exercises/variables.js`
// */


// EXAMPLE: Write code below to assign Harry Potter's name to a variable and
// log that variable to the console:
var name = "Harry Potter";
console.log(name);

// EXAMPLE: Write code below to add 2 to the variable `students` and
// log the result:
var enrolledStudents = 22 + 2;
console.log(enrolledStudents);

// YOU DO:
// Write code below to save the string 'Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!'
// log that variable to the console.
var plot = 'Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!';
console.log(plot);


// YOU DO:
// Declare three variables, named `firstName`, `isHungry` and `numberOfPets`.
  // Store the appropriate data types in each.
// log all three variables to the console.

var firstName = 'Susanna';
var isHungry = false;
var numberOfPets = 2;
console.log (firstName);
console.log (isHungry);
console.log (numberOfPets);


// IN WORDS:
// How did you decide to use the data type you did for each of the three variables above?
  // Explain.

 //I used each data type that I did because the prompts for each variable made the most sense to me. For firstName, it made sense to me to use a string, for isHungry, it made the most sense to use boolean logic, and for numberOfPets, it made more sense to use an actual interger versus typing it out as a string.


// YOU DO:
// Re-assign the values to the three variables from the previous challenge to different
  // values (but same data type).
// log all three variables to the console.
var firstName = 'Opal';
var isHungry = true;
var numberOfPets = 1;
console.log (firstName);
console.log (isHungry);
console.log (numberOfPets);

// YOU DO:
// Using the variables below, log the total number of snacks to the console:
var healthySnacks = 6;
var junkFoodSnacks = 8;

var answer = (healthySnacks + junkFoodSnacks)
console.log (answer)

//-------------------
// FINAL CHECK
//-------------------

// Did you run this file in your terminal to make sure everything printed out to the console
// as you would expect?

//No, this is not running as expected and I am not sure why.
