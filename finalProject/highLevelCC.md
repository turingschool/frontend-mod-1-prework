## Ceasar Cipher

1. This problem will require a function to interpret the a-z alphabet and shift the characters based on input parameters, like a decoder ring

1. The computer will need to be told how to create the cipher based on which direction to shift, and how many spaces to move, then log the cipher

1. We'll need a "key" to determine the shift code and a place to store the alphabet

1. Create an array to hold the characters of the alphabet

1. Write a function that will interpret the characters numerically

1. Write a function that will tell the computer to shift each number left or right *n* number of spaces

1. Console log the interpreted string
