1. Create a variable called alphabet and assign it to an array of all 26 letters.
2. Create a function called caesarCipher with the parameter string and shift.
3. Create a variable called letters and assign it to string.split() and another variable called newString thats assigned to an empty string.
4. Iterate over the string until it reaches the string's length.
5. Create a conditional statement and have letters[i] be compared to the alphabet variable.
6. If it matches, then have it be that letter + shift value to move up on the array.
7. Have newString += all of the letters until the loop ends
8. Return newString.
