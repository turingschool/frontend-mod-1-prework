## Ceasar Cipher

1. Set an alphabet with each character to reference or pull from later.

2. Create a way to store a word or several words (whatever it is you want to apply the cipher to), accompanying a value for how many spaces we're going to try to shift the word, within the alphabet we've provided.

3. Create a way to turn the word we choose, to output in ALL CAPITAL letters.

4. Take the word of our choosing, and split that word into individual, capitalized characters, to look similar to the alphabet we provided.

5. Run through the entire index or length of our provided alphabet, and find a way to compare that alphabet with the capitalized and split value of the word of our choosing.

6. If those two items are equal, create a way to shift the characters of our chosen word, however many spaces within our provided alphabet, we desire.

7. Ask the program to display the output of your word, shifted the amount of spaces of your choosing, in all capital letters.
