1. create a function that will take in a string to be deciphered and a number that will say how many shifts over the alphabet should move.
2. make a variable that will convert any string passed through to lowercase so that it is uniform.
3. create a variable called `alphabet` that includes every letter in the alphabet. add the `.split()` method to split each letter by one space.
4. create a for loop that will iterate over the string (or code we want to decipher)
5. create an if statement saying if there is a space in the string that it remains a space.
6. create several more if statements that uses the number declared as the shift value to move across the alphabet and decide which letters will be used.
7. call the function with the console log and put in a string and number value.
