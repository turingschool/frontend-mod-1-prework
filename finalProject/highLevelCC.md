/*
plain:  ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
cipher: XYZABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVW
```

## The Prompt

Write a program that will take any String, and encode it based on a provided shift value. The interaction pattern for this program might look something like this:

```javascript
encode("Hello World", 5); //should log "CZGGJ RJMGY"

encode("Hi", 2); //should log "FG"
```

## Your Task

Add a `highLevelCC.md` file to your `finalProject` directory. In that file, write up high level notes about how you would solve this problem. When you're finished writing your detailed notes, it is optional to implement a solution in code.
