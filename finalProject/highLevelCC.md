The first thing I would do is make a ceasarCipher class in my js.   
I would then make the class hold a cipher() method holding a string.   
Then add an alphabet var in all caps, since it doesnt matter much to us yet.
Then adjust the shift to 26.   
Then make an if else statement iterating over the data. Also going through special characters.   
Then return the encoded text.
