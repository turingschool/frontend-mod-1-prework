**What are you going to work on?**
* I really love HackerRank and I’ll continue to use that to keep up on skills. During quarantine I mostly did python and SQL, so I’ll be starting up again with JavaScript and more HTML.
* My brother-in-law is helping his younger brother with a startup and they will be needing a website built. My brother-in-law has offered to guide me as I build it so that I can have a real world project to work on. He’s an experienced programmer and loves to teach so I am excited to work with him.

**What days are you going to work?**
* I normally work M-F just so that I can keep some kind of schedule and routine.

**What times on those days are you going to work?**
* I like to work in the morning and through to the afternoon.

**Where are you going to be sitting/standing as you do this?**
* The desk in my room is my home base for working, however, I tend to float around the house when I feel like working near my sisters or if I need to use the TV in the living room as a second monitor.

**Where are you documenting this plan? Google Calendar, calendar on your wall, your journal?**
* I have an hourly paper planner that I’ve been using and it helps me stay on track even if some days I stray from my schedule.
* I also keep track of tasks in a notebook

**Do any stakeholders in your life know about this plan? (The answer needs to be yes by the time you answer this...)**
* Oh absolutely. My “roommates” (my two sisters and brother-in-law) are very involved in my plans. We all hold each other accountable and are each other's biggest supporters since 3 of us are back in school again.

**What personal items/events are important to you during this time? How are you going to make sure those are not neglected? (Hint, block time on the calendar for them!)**
* Just my birthday and Thanksgiving!
