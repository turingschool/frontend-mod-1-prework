# Ceasar Cipher




1. I would create a function that accepts two parameters ("plainText String", shiftValue integer). Within this function we would need to split the plainText string into letters using the .split method. We would also need to account for capital letters and special characters.

1. Using a loop within the function, we would need to iterate the characters of the plainText argument and then re-assign each letter to a new letter based on the shiftValue integer provided. I researched some methods and I think using the ASCII chart would be the easiest.

1. Using an if statement, we would use the ASCII numbers that correspond to the alphabet and  the shiftValue to apply conditions that our plainText string would  work through.

1. Once the letters have been re-assigned, the program should result out with a new encoded string.
