## Final Project - Next Steps Plan

What is your plan and how are you going to hold yourself to it? Specifically...

1. What are you going to work on? Resources here.
... Schedule the workload below. Based on available time, determine priorities
... I'm going to review Turing Mod 1 to Mod 4
... I'm going to take the Code Academy javascript course
... I'm going to take a Udemy javascript course.
... I'm going to take the Code Academy Ruby course

2. What days are you going to work?
... Monday to Friday 1 to 2 hours a day

3. What times on those days are you going to work?
... I will work from 11a MT to 1p MT each day

4. Where you going to be sitting/standing as you do this?
... I will sit either in my office, kitchen or bedroom depending on my mood

5. Where are you documenting this plan? Google Calendar, calendar on your wall, your journal?
... I'll document it in my calendar
... I'll have a google sheet agenda to ensure I can complete all this work in the dedicated time

6. Do any stakeholders in your life know about this plan? (The answer needs to be yes by the time you answer this...)
... Yes, I've shared with friends and family

7. What personal items/events are important to you during this time? How are you going to make sure those are not neglected? (Hint, block time on the calendar for them!)
... I'll be working a full time job during this period so I'll have to manage around those needs
... I'll have a consistent and energizing workout routine that I'll manage
... And, I have all the other aspects of life including food, shelter, money, emotional support and beyond
... I'll calendar many of these areas as best I can to manage, prioritize and establish a good balance
