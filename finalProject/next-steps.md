## Next Steps

Depending on if you are in Section A or B, you have anywhere between 1.5-3.5 weeks before you start Mod 1. This is an important time to take care of life things such as doctor appointments, dog park trips, quality time with friends and family, etc. It is also important that you maintain the knowledge and skills you acquired during Mod 0 and this pre-work. You can absolutely do both, but to do so successfully, you need a plan. We recommend spending, on average, 1-2 hours a day coding (totally 20-40 hours of time).

1. What is your plan and how are you going to hold yourself to it? Specifically...

    My plan is to spend 3-5 hours a day practicing coding, cementing the knowledge I have now, and taking in new concepts. I would like to wake up each morning and hold myself accountable to a 3-5 hour time slot with breaks in which I dedicate myself to practice. I am not currently working, so I feel this is very achievable.


1. What are you going to work on? Resources here.

    I have a javascript Udemy course to work through, and I was going to work my way through [javascript codeacademy](https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/language/java)tutorials as well. I also want to attempt some coding challenges and exercises. I found a list from [w3schools](https://www.w3resource.com/java-exercises/).

1. What days are you going to work?

    I am going to be working M-F in the mornings on my practice. For the holiday Thanksgiving that falls right before the 2011 cohort, I intend to replace that day with a day over the weekend to finalize my practice and make sure I am ready for class to begin on Monday.

1. What times on those days are you going to work?

    I will be working from 9am-2pm.

1. Where you going to be sitting/standing as you do this?

  I will be sitting at my dedicated work area, and will implement breaks to stretch and take short walks.

1. Where are you documenting this plan? Google Calendar, calendar on your wall, your journal?

  I will create a google calendar reminder for each day until class starts. I will outline my proposed time slot for working.

1. Do any stakeholders in your life know about this plan? (The answer needs to be yes by the time you answer this...)

   Yes, my partner is very aware of my time committment, and when class starts we have discussed how responsibilities will shift and how to interact while I'm in class or working in my "concentration zone".

1. What personal items/events are important to you during this time? How are you going to make sure those are not neglected? (Hint, block time on the calendar for them!)

  The afternoon will be open for myself to work on some personal projects, spend quality time with my partner, and relax before the intense course begins. Thanksgiving will be a day off, and I have a plan to make up that time.
