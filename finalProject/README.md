# Final Project

## Project Specifications

Using what you have learned so far, complete the challenges below. Put any files related to the projects you choose in `finalProject` directory.

_Note:_ These should be challenging, and require to apply most of the content covered in this pre-work. The use of google is absolutely allowed as you may need to brush up on syntax, etc. However, we strongly discourage you from googling for solution pathways to these problems - the point of these is to push you to think like the programmer you are and apply the knowledge you've built so far in slightly different ways.

* [10 Speckled Frogs](./10_speckled_frogs.md)
* [Ceasar Cipher](./ceasar_cipher.md)

## Next Steps

Depending on if you are in Section A or B, you have anywhere between 1.5-3.5 weeks before you start Mod 1. This is an important time to take care of life things such as doctor appointments, dog park trips, quality time with friends and family, etc. It is also important that you maintain the knowledge and skills you acquired during Mod 0 and this pre-work. You can absolutely do both, but to do so successfully, **you need a plan**. We recommend spending, on average, 1-2 hours a day coding (totally 20-40 hours of time).

What is your plan and how are you going to hold yourself to it? Specifically...
- What are you going to work on? Resources here.

I see this as a time to branch out from deadlines and really learn to dive into a subject at a time.  I have found that I have compiled quite a few resources that I have not had time to really absorb.  Most of these are online:
### Resources:
1. typing

2. Git

3. Shortcuts

  * https://mod0.turing.io/session1/#shortcuts
4. Googling!
5. Comparisons (Really get a handle on boolean returns of 0)
  * https://javascript.info/comparison
6. Array commands and appendages

I plan to read a large portion of JavaScript and JQuery by
Jon Duckett and begin to dive in to a deeper understanding.

One thing I am battling with is that W3 seems to oput a lot of focus on HTML from the beginning of their course.  I became aware that the staff at Turing does not exactly recommend going to them for answers but I do not know how they feel about diving in to get a look around and found that it could be beneficial for me, though it would be a task to make it through much of the material and I would like to hear back on an opinion about this and any suggestions.

- What days are you going to work?

I will be working on this every weekday and sporadically on the weekends, taking Sunday afternoons off.

- What times on those days are you going to work?

On coding: I plan to work 8-11AM on weekdays.

- Where you going to be sitting/standing as you do this?

This work will be done in my office space at my desk.  Sometimes, especially if the kids end up doing remote schooling, I will work at our dining room table.

- Where are you documenting this plan? Google Calendar, calendar on your wall, your journal?

I am using a paper printout calendar to document my time.

- Do any stakeholders in your life know about this plan? (The answer needs to be yes by the time you answer this...)

Yes, my wife will be working but my son (17 yr old) will be remote schooling and will be closeby and I have covered with him that he will be my stakeholder while she is out.

- What personal items/events are important to you during this time? How are you going to make sure those are not neglected? (Hint, block time on the calendar for them!)

It is important to me to plan a time period for Thanksgiving with my nuclear family.  It is important for me to complete some cleaning tasks around my house so that I feel ready to jump into being away to a certain extent.  On that note, I plan to do some auto work to be prepared for the winter for my family's cars. It is important to do some basic cleanout on another level, as I have jumped into going through old paperwork and it has been interesting to see what has happened in my mind already in this process.  I became emotionally exhausted last night for instance, while looking through old books on subject matters that I find interesting, informative, and necessary for my growth.  Many of these books and compilations (mostly music oriented) remain unfinished and it became difficult to accept this new life when the prior one is entirely unfinished, almost unrealized.  It was a surprise to feel this way and I bring this up here because now it has become clear that some time for personal reflection will be necessary before this upcoming time of dedication. I was successful as a musician and I should learn to accept that instead of focus on what is unfinished in that world. It is important to me to come to the determination that my career is changing but my life remains on a timeline that has a new node and is not an endcap. I can easily get excited when I complete a block of code and then drop into being overwhelmed about this choice when I speak to a mentor so I believe I have personal work to accomplish in this realm.
Lastly, it is important to wrap up some loose ends and visit some friends and family that I have not seen for a while.  It will be easy for me to hibernate but I would like to pay my respects to those I love and have a hang before adventuring off.  


## Deliverables

In the appropriate thread in your pre-work group channel, share the the plan that you developed in the Next Steps section. The point is sharing is to collaborate and inspire - potentially find opportunities to work together on some things, maybe show an organizational strategy you have with others, or just see the thought your cohort mates are putting into this as well, so you don't feel alone! That being said, don't shy away from sharing your _detailed_ plan. This is a great chance to support each other in staying accountable to this plan.
