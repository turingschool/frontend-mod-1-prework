Array Methods Definition:
**array.pop**: *this method lets us write code which will remove the last element from the array and then when we ask for it, the element is returned to us as the one which was removed. When this is done, the length of the array will change. For example if I have three drinks, and run the command, the final drink of the list will be removed when I run the console log for my drinks with the pop command.*


**array.push**:
*this method lets the developer to write a command that will add additional elements to the array and returns to us, the new length of the array (with the new elements added). For example, if I run a variable for cars and list 3 cars and then run the push command, then the code will automatically add in the additional list (pushed into the array). Additionally, the total of what is listed in the array will be shown to us through the console.log (if I had started with two cars and added 3 more, both the new cars will be shown in the array, but the number will increase from 2 to 5).*


**array.shift**:
*this method lets us removed the first element from an array, changing the length of array. It is similar the array.pop but it is focused on removing and returning the information about the first element listed in the array as defined by the variable.*



**array.unshift**:
*this method lets us add one or more additional elements to our array but they will be at the beginning of the array (thus not in order, if for example adding/unshifting [4,5] to an array of [1,2,3], the full array would now read [4,5,1,2,3]).*
