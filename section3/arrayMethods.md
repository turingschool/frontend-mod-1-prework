1. Pop
- Using the pop method will delete the last element in an array. It will return that element to the caller.

2. Push
- The push method allows you to add elements to the end of an array, and it returns the new length of the object you're adding values to.

3. Shift
- The shift method works like the pop method except it removes the first element, and returns it to it's caller.

4. Unshift
- The unshift method is going to add new elements to the front of the array, and return the new length value of the object the array is for.
