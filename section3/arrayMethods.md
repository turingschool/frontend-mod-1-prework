## Array Methods


- The `pop()` array method takes the last element from an array, and then returns that last element. This changes the length of the array.


- The `push()` array method adds an element (or several) to the *end* of the array, and then returns the new length of the array.


- The `shift()` array method takes the first element and returns the element that was removed. This changes the length of the array.


- The `unshift()` array method adds an element (or several) to the *beginning* of the array, and then returns the new length of the array.
