## POP

The pop() method removes the last element from an array and returns that element.
This method changes the length of the array.

--> Basically it pops the end of the array of the stack. Just like popping a zit,
but definitely less nasty.

## PUSH

The push() method adds one or more elements to the end of an array and returns the new length of the array.
It also changes the length of the array.

--> Basically, the push method is like pushing more of your dirty clothes under the bed. The space underneath
the bed is the array and you're just pushing one more item into the array.
## SHIFT

The shift() method removes the first element from an array and returns that removed element. This method changes the length of the array.

--> Shift is like shifting a line of plates or a conveyor belt, all down by one. The first element falls off the conveyor belt,
but if someone chooses to store it in a variable that is what is returned, because nobody likes to be wasteful, even with code.
## UNSHIFT

The unshift() method adds one or more elements to the beginning of an array and returns the new length of the array.

--> Unshift is basically moving the conveyor belt the opposite direction. It opens up one more spot in the array
and increases the length. Since it's moving in the proper direction, nothing falls off the conveyor belt.
