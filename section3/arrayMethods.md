An __array__ is a variable that is able to hold multiple values of different data types.
It is useful to think of an array like a list of related items. Arrays have a number of methods to
add, remove and shift elements from itself. Here are four that add and remove elements from the beginning
and end of the array.

+ __Pop()__ removes the last element from an array and adjusts the array's length (number of values within the list).
+ __Push()__ adds one or more elements to the end of an array and outputs the new length.
+ __Shift()__ removes the first element of the array and changes the length to factor in one less element.
+ __Unshift ()__ adds one or more elements to the beginning of the array and adjusts the length according to the number
of additional elements.
