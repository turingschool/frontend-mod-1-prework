The .pop method "pops" off the last element in an array (the element at index -1). After doing this, the method finishes out by returning
  the array minus the element removed.

The .push method adds one or more elements to end of an array. After doing so, the method then returns the new length of the array.

The .shift method functions the same as the .pop method, except that it removes the the first element of the array (the element at index 0).

The .unshift method functions the same as the .push method, except that it adds an element to the beginning of the array (the element added
  becoming the new array element that is located at index 0).
