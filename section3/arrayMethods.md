## MDN Documentation Methods

- `pop` removes the last element/part of an array and changes the length to fit the new size
- `push` instead adds one (or more) elements to the end of the array
- `shift` does the same as `pop`, but removes the first element as opposed to last
- `unshift` adds one (or more) elements to the beginning of the array
