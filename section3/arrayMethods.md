## Array Methods

1. `Array.pop()`:

   The `.pop()` method will remove the last item from the end of an array. It will return the item that was popped off.  

1. `Array.push()`:

   The `.push()` method lets you add any number of elements to the end of an array, and will return the updated length of the array.

1. `Array.shift()`:

   The `.shift()` method can take away the first element in an array, and returns that removed element. Sort of like an inverse of the `.pop()` method.

1. `Array.unshift()`:

   The `.unshift()` method will add any number of elements to the beginning of an array, and will return the updated length of the array. Sort of like an inverse of the `.push()` method.
