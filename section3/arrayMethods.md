### Array Methods

- Array.prototype.pop()
  - The pop() method changes the length of the array by removing the last element from the array; this element is what is returned.

- Array.prototype.push()
  - The push() method is used to add one or more elements to the end of an array; the new length of the array is what is returned.

- Array.prototype.shift()
  - The shift() method works like the pop() method in that it changes the length of the array, but by effecting the first element of the array. When the method is used, the element is removed and is what is returned.

- Array.prototype.unshift()
  - The unshift() method works like the push() method  in that it is used to add one or more elements to an array, but this method adds the new elements to the beginning of the array; when used, the new length of the array is what is returned.
