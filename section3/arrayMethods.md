# Array Methods

1. Pop()
  * will remove the last element from the array
2. Push()
  * will add, at the end of the array, a new element
3. Shift()
  * takes away or removes the first element from the array and then "shifts"
  * all other elements to a lower index
4. Unshift()
  * adds an element to the beginning of the array and "unshifts" older arrays
  * meaning they now have a higher index
