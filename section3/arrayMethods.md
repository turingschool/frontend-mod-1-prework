# Array Methods
1. POP
* From what I can tell, the pop method simply removes the *last* element from an array.
2. PUSH
* Conversely from pop, the push method adds elements to the end of an array.
3. SHIFT
* Shift simply removes the *first* element from an array. This would be the element in the zero pocket.
4. UNSHIFT
* We have a theme here! Unshift *ADDS* items to the beginning of an array. Boom.
