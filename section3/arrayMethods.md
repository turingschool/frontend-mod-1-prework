# Method Definitions

## Pop- This method removes the last element of an array and returns that element. It changes the length of the array because the last element has been removed.

## Push- This method adds one or more elements to the end of an array and returns the new length of the array. It also changes the length of the array because element(s) are being added to the end of the index.

## Shift- This is like the _pop method_, but instead of removing the last element of an array, it removes the first element (or 0 index) This returns the removed element, and just like the others, changes the length of the array.

## Unshift- Similar to the _push method_, this adds elements to the beginning of an array and returns the new length of the appended array.
