In the exercises below, write your own code where indicated

Two examples are already completed. Your task is to complete
any remaining prompt.

// EXAMPLE: Write code below that iterates through a list of animals and print
// each animal.
var animals = ["Zebra", "Giraffe", "Elephant"];

for (var i = 0; i < animals.length; i++) {
  console.log(animals[i]);
}

// YOU DO: Write code below that iterates through a list of animals and prints "The
// <animal> is awesome!" for each animal.
for (var animals = 0; animals <= 3; animals++) {
 console.log(animals + "is awesome");
}


// YOU DO: Create an array of foods and then iterate over that array to log "Add
// <food> to shopping list" for each food item.
var foods = ["pizza", "burger", "soda"];
for (var foods = 0; foods <= 3; foods++); {
 console.log("Add" + foods + "to shopping list");
}



// YOU DO: Create an array of numbers and then iterate over that array to log double
// of each of the number. (Ex: 4 doubled is 8.)
var (num = 0; num < 0; num++) {
 console.log(num *2);
}


// YOU DO: Using the array of names below, print out "Happy Birthday <name>" for
// each name except the first two.
var names = ["Sevy", "Lindsey", "Jericho", "Raeonna", "Latrina", "Jhana", "Luca"];
var (names = 0; names <=7; names++) {
 console.log("Happy Birthday" + names);
}


// THE FINAL YOU DO: Using the array of ages below, print out a statement for each age.
// The age should determine which message is printed out:
  // Under 18? "Oh no, you can't vote quite yet."
  // 18 or over? "Make sure you get out and vote!"
if (ages < 18) {
 console.log("Under 18? Oh no, you can't vote quite yet.") } else (ages >= 18) {
  console.log("18 or over? Make sure you get out and vote!");
}
// WORD FROM THE WISE: Before you start coding, jot down, with pen and paper, what steps you
// want to tell the program to take. Think of all the concepts you've learned so far.

// Remember, stuck for 15-20 minutes? Reach out to your pre-work group on Slack.

var ages = [17, 20, 34, 18, 16, 65, 49, 10, 22, 18];
