Two examples are already completed. Your task is to complete

//-------------------
// LEVEL 1: Loops
//-------------------

// EXAMPLE: Write code that logs to the console "I love hedgehogs!" 9 times:
for (var i = 0; i < 9; i++) {
  console.log("I love hedgehogs!");
}

// EXAMPLE: Write code that logs to the console the value of `i`, 3 times:
for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}

// What is logged to the console for this second example? Why?
// EXPLAIN:
// 0,1,2 is logged to the console because the first time the program ran, i was
// equal to 0, since the condition stated that the loop would run if i < 3 then it ran, then added a 1
//to i and logged 0 to the console. Then the program ran again.
//The second time the program loop ran, i was equal to 1, it was less than 3, it added 1 to i, logged
// 1 and ran again ...and so on til i was not less than 3 and it stopped. 


 // YOU DO: Write code below that logs to the console, the sum of 2 plus 2, 7 times:
for (var i = 0; i < 7; i++) {
  console.log(2 + 2);
}

 // YOU DO: Write code below that logs the String 'She sells seashells down by the seashore'
 // 10 times.
 for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
   console.log("She sells seashells down by the seashore.");
 }


//-------------------
// LEVEL 2: An Added Layer of Challenge
//-------------------

// YOU DO: Write code below that logs to the console a String of "This is loop number: "
//that concatenates with `i`.
for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  console.log("This is loop number: " + (i));
}

// YOU DO: Using a for loop, how could you get an output that looks like this:
for (var i = 10; i >= 1; i--) {
  console.log(i);
}
// 10
// 9
// 8
// 7
// 6
// 5
// 4
// 3
// 2
// 1

// Not sure? Try to google some terms that seem relevant. Play around with it. Don't spend
// more than 15 minutes without making progress. If you are at 15 minutes and haven't made
// progress, that means it's time to reach out to your pre-work group on Slack!
