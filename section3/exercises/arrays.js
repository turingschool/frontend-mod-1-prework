//-------------------
// PART 1: Animals: Array Syntax
//-------------------

// EXAMPLE: write code below that will log an array of animals.
// Store the array in a variable.
var animals = ["Zebra", "Giraffe", "Elephant"];
console.log(animals);


// EXAMPLE: Write code below that will log "Zebra" from the animals array
// YOUR CODE HERE
console.log(animals[0]);


// YOU DO: Write code below that will log the number of elements in array of
// animals from above.
console.log(animals.length);


// YOU DO: Write code that will reassign the last item in the animals
// array to "Gorilla"
animals.pop();
animals.push("Gorilla");

console.log(animals);


// YOU DO: Write code that will add a new animal (type of your choice) to position 3.
animals.push("Red Panda");

console.log(animals);


// YOU DO: Write code that will log the String "Elephant" in the animals array
animals.unshift("Elephant");

console.log(animals);


//-------------------
// PART 2: Foods: Array Methods
//-------------------

// YOU DO: Declare a variable that will store an an array of at least 4 foods (strings)
var foods = ['nuts', 'beans', 'seeds', 'lentils'];


// YOU DO: Write code below that will log the number of elements in the array of
// foods from above.
console.log(foods.length);


// YOU DO: Write code below that uses a method to add "broccoli" to the foods array and
// log the changed array to verify "broccoli" has been added
foods.unshift('broccoli');

console.log(foods);


// YOU DO: Write code below that removes the last item of food from the foods array and
// log the changed array to verify that item has been removed
foods.pop();

console.log(foods);


// YOU DO: Write code to add 3 new foods to the array.
  // There are several ways to do this - choose whichever you'd like!
// Then, log the changed array to verify the new items have been added
foods.push('tofu', 'seitan', 'jackfruit');

console.log(foods);

// YOU DO: Remove the food that is in index position 0.
foods.shift();

console.log(foods);


//-------------------
// PART 3: Where are Arrays used?
//-------------------

/*
Sometimes we need to hold on to multiple pieces of data, but have it grouped together in a list.
This is why programming languages have arrays!

One example of a web/mobile application that uses arrays is Instagram. Each user has a set of posts
associated with their account. Each post, is one of potentially many, that are grouped together in a list,
or, array.

The post itself likely has more complex data, but here's one way we can think about it:
*/

var posts = ["image at beach", "holiday party", "adorable puppy", "video of cute baby"];

// YOU DO: Think of a web application you commonly use. Where do you see LISTS utilized, where arrays
// may be storing data? Come up with 3 examples - they could be from different web applications or
// all from the same one.

// 1: Reddit probably uses arrays to group the list of comments that you've made on different posts.
// 2: Reddit also probably uses arrays to group the list of subreddits that you have subscribed to.
// 3: They probably also use them to group the list of awards that you have from posts and comments.

// Part 4: Don't let yourself forget everything from Section 2 of Pre-work
//-------------------

/*
YOU DO:
Using the variables defined below, write a program that will tell a user if they
will be able to call an Uber.

The user can call an uber if they have 15% battery remaining, or more. In this case, it doesn't matter
if the user has a charger at all, or what type.
The can call an uber if they have a charger and it is a car charger.

*/
var percentBatteryLeft = 12;
var hasCharger = true;
var chargerType = 'car';

// Write your conditional here
// This line asks if the value assigned to the variable percentBatteryLeft is greater than or equal to 15.
if (percentBatteryLeft >= 15) {
//This line tells the computer that if the value returned from the previous line returns true, then it should log the string 'You can call an uber!'.
  console.log('You can call an uber!');
//This line says that if the value from line 138 returns 'false', then the computer should ask if both the value assigned to the variable hasCharger is strictly equal to true AND the value assigned to the variable chargerType is strictly equal to 'car'.
} else if( hasCharger === true && chargerType === 'car') {
//This line says that if the value returned by line 138 is false and the value returned by line 142 is true, then it should log the string 'You can call an uber!'.
  console.log('You can call an uber!');
//This line gives the computer an option for when both lines 138 and 142 return values of false. This command will be completely ignored if either of those lines returns a value of true.
} else{
//This line tells the computer that if both lines 138 and 142 return values of true, then it should log the string 'You cannot call an uber!'.
  console.log('You cannot call an uber!');
}


// YOU DO - ANNOTATE: Above each line of your code for this if statement, create a comment.
// That comment should describe, in your own words, and as technically precise as possible,
// what the line of code below, does.

// MAKE 100% SURE that you have RUN the code in node in your command line, to ensure it works
// as you think it doesðŸŒŸ
