//-------------------
// PART 1: Animals: Array Syntax
//-------------------

// EXAMPLE: write code below that will log an array of animals.
// Store the array in a variable.
var animals = ["Zebra", "Giraffe", "Elephant"];
console.log(animals);

// EXAMPLE: Write code below that will log "Zebra" from the animals array
// YOUR CODE HERE
console.log(animals[0]);

// YOU DO: Write code below that will log the number of elements in array of
// animals from above.
console.log(animals.length);


// YOU DO: Write code that will reassign the last item in the animals
// array to "Gorilla"
animals[2] = "Gorilla";
console.log(animals);


// YOU DO: Write code that will add a new animal (type of your choice) to position 3.
animals[3] = "Tiger";
console.log(animals);


// YOU DO: Write code that will log the String "Elephant" in the animals array
animals[4] = "Elephant";
console.log(animals);

//-------------------
// PART 2: Foods: Array Methods
//-------------------

// YOU DO: Declare a variable that will store an an array of at least 4 foods (strings)
var foodArray = ["Ramen", "Pizza", "Burrito", "Salad"];

// YOU DO: Write code below that will log the number of elements in the array of
// foods from above.
console.log(foodArray.length);


// YOU DO: Write code below that uses a method to add "broccoli" to the foods array and
// log the changed array to verify "broccoli" has been added
foodArray[4] = "Broccoli";
console.log(foodArray);

// YOU DO: Write code below that removes the last item of food from the foods array and
// log the changed array to verify that item has been removed
console.log(foodArray.pop());

console.log(foodArray);


// YOU DO: Write code to add 3 new foods to the array.
  // There are several ways to do this - choose whichever you'd like!
// Then, log the changed array to verify the new items have been added
console.log(foodArray.push("Couscous", "Rice", "Beans"));
console.log(foodArray);


// YOU DO: Remove the food that is in index position 0.
console.log(foodArray.shift());

console.log(foodArray);

//-------------------
// PART 3: Where are Arrays used?
//-------------------

/*
Sometimes we need to hold on to multiple pieces of data, but have it grouped together in a list.
This is why programming languages have arrays!

One example of a web/mobile application that uses arrays is Instagram. Each user has a set of posts
associated with their account. Each post, is one of potentially many, that are grouped together in a list,
or, array.

The post itself likely has more complex data, but here's one way we can think about it:
*/

var posts = ["image at beach", "holiday party", "adorable puppy", "video of cute baby"];

// YOU DO: Think of a web application you commonly use. Where do you see LISTS utilized, where arrays
// may be storing data? Come up with 3 examples - they could be from different web applications or
// all from the same one.

// 1: Any website that has a "Shopping cart".
// 2: A website with a drop down menu to choose from.
// 3: Looking at a "Recently viewed" section on a site.

// Part 4: Don't let yourself forget everything from Section 2 of Pre-work
//-------------------

/*
YOU DO:
Using the variables defined below, write a program that will tell a user if they
will be able to call an Uber.

The user can call an uber if they have 15% battery remaining, or more. In this case, it doesn't matter
if the user has a charger at all, or what type.
The can call an uber if they have a charger and it is a car charger.

*/
var percentBatteryLeft = 10;
var hasCharger = false;
var chargerType = "car";

// Write your conditional here
// The line of code here shows that regardless of the other circumstances, if the percentBatteryLeft
// is >= 15, the user is still able to call an Uber.
if (percentBatteryLeft >= 15) {
  console.log("User can call an Uber!");
// This next line shows that if that condition is false, we move on to the next. Maybe the battery
//is less than 15, but if we have a charger and it's a car charger, we can still call an uber.
} else if (percentBatteryLeft < 15 && hasCharger === true && chargerType === "car") {
  console.log("User can call an Uber!");
// This next line shows that if the previous is false, and we are less than 15 percent, but we don't
// have a charger either, we cannot call an uber.
} else if (percentBatteryLeft < 15 && hasCharger === false) {
  console.log("User cannot call an Uber!");
// Lastly, if all of these are false, it's fair to say that the user cannot call an uber if we've
// Exhausted the only combinations that would allow this to happen.
} else {
  console.log("User cannot call an Uber!");
}

// I'm a little unclear on the best method for organizing these. Not sure how many combinations
// to showcase before providing the else condition. Perhaps I missed this and I'm going to do some
// more research. 


// YOU DO - ANNOTATE: Above each line of your code for this if statement, create a comment.
// That comment should describe, in your own words, and as technically precise as possible,
// what the line of code below, does.

// MAKE 100% SURE that you have RUN the code in node in your command line, to ensure it works
// as you think it doesðŸŒŸ
