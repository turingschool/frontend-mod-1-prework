//-------------------
// PART 1: Animals: Array Syntax
//-------------------

// EXAMPLE: write code below that will log an array of animals.
// Store the array in a variable.
var animals = ["Zebra", "Giraffe", "Elephant"];
console.log(animals);

// EXAMPLE: Write code below that will log "Zebra" from the animals array
// YOUR CODE HERE
console.log(animals[0]);

// YOU DO: Write code below that will log the number of elements in array of
// animals from above.
console.log(animals.length);


// YOU DO: Write code that will reassign the last item in the animals
// array to "Gorilla"
animals.push("Gorilla");
console.log(animals);


// YOU DO: Write code that will add a new animal (type of your choice) to position 3.
animals.splice(2, 0, "Tiger");
console.log(animals);


// YOU DO: Write code that will log the String "Elephant" in the animals array
console.log(animals[3]);


//-------------------
// PART 2: Foods: Array Methods
//-------------------

// YOU DO: Declare a variable that will store an an array of at least 4 foods (strings)
var myFoods = ["pasta","pizza","hamburger","sushi"];


// YOU DO: Write code below that will log the number of elements in the array of
// foods from above.
console.log(myFoods.length);


// YOU DO: Write code below that uses a method to add "broccoli" to the foods array and
// log the changed array to verify "broccoli" has been added
myFoods.unshift("broccoli");
console.log(myFoods);


// YOU DO: Write code below that removes the last item of food from the foods array and
// log the changed array to verify that item has been removed
myFoods.pop();
console.log(myFoods);


// YOU DO: Write code to add 3 new foods to the array.
  // There are several ways to do this - choose whichever you'd like!
// Then, log the changed array to verify the new items have been added
myFoods.push("sandwich","quesadilla","kebab");
console.log(myFoods);

// YOU DO: Remove the food that is in index position 0.
myFoods.shift();
console.log(myFoods);
//-------------------
// PART 3: Where are Arrays used?
//-------------------

/*
Sometimes we need to hold on to multiple pieces of data, but have it grouped together in a list.
This is why programming languages have arrays!

One example of a web/mobile application that uses arrays is Instagram. Each user has a set of posts
associated with their account. Each post, is one of potentially many, that are grouped together in a list,
or, array.

The post itself likely has more complex data, but here's one way we can think about it:
*/

var posts = ["image at beach", "holiday party", "adorable puppy", "video of cute baby"];

// YOU DO: Think of a web application you commonly use. Where do you see LISTS utilized, where arrays
// may be storing data? Come up with 3 examples - they could be from different web applications or
// all from the same one.

// 1: YouTube playlists
// 2: Spotify albums
// 3: Google Drive folders


//-------------------
// Part 4: Don't let yourself forget everything from Section 2 of Pre-work
//-------------------

/*
YOU DO:
Using the variables defined below, write a program that will tell a user if they
will be able to call an Uber.

The user can call an uber if they have 15% battery remaining, or more. In this case, it doesn't matter
if the user has a charger at all, or what type.
The can call an uber if they have a charger and it is a car charger.

*/
var percentBatteryLeft = 12;
var hasCharger = false;
var chargerType = "car";

// Write your conditional here

/*This `if` statement uses the "or" logical operator || to determine whether one of two conditions is true.
In the first condition, percentBatteryLeft must be greater than or equal to 15 to be true. If that condition is false,
the program checks the following condition. This next condition combines the comparisons of hasCharger equals
true and chargerType equals "car" within itself. In order to do this, the second condition is placed in parentheses,
using the "and" logical operator && to ensure that both comparisons must be true for the condition to be met.
*/
if (percentBatteryLeft >= 15 || (hasCharger === true && chargerType === "car")) {
//If either of the conditions separated by || are true, the console logs the string "I can call an Uber".
  console.log("I can call an Uber");
}
//If both of the conditions in the above `if` statement are false, the program moves on to the `else` statement.
else {
//Once the `else` statement is reached, the console will log the string "I can't get a ride".
  console.log("I can't get a ride");
}


// YOU DO - ANNOTATE: Above each line of your code for this if statement, create a comment.
// That comment should describe, in your own words, and as technically precise as possible,
// what the line of code below, does.

// MAKE 100% SURE that you have RUN the code in node in your command line, to ensure it works
// as you think it doesðŸŒŸ
