//-------------------
// PART 1: Animals: Array Syntax
//-------------------

// EXAMPLE: write code below that will log an array of animals.
// Store the array in a variable.
var animals = ["Zebra", "Giraffe", "Elephant"];
console.log(animals);

// EXAMPLE: Write code below that will log "Zebra" from the animals array
// YOUR CODE HERE
console.log(animals[0]);

// YOU DO: Write code below that will log the number of elements in array of
// animals from above.
console.log(animals.length);

// YOU DO: Write code that will reassign the last item in the animals
// array to "Gorilla"
animals[animals.length -1] = "Gorilla";

// YOU DO: Write code that will add a new animal (type of your choice) to position 3.
animals[3] = "Penguin";

// YOU DO: Write code that will log the String "Elephant" in the animals array
animals.push("Elephant");
console.log(animals);

//-------------------
// PART 2: Foods: Array Methods
//-------------------

// YOU DO: Declare a variable that will store an an array of at least 4 foods (strings)
var foods = ["apple", "banana", "pear", "plum", "blueberry"];

// YOU DO: Write code below that will log the number of elements in the array of
// foods from above.
console.log(foods.length);

// YOU DO: Write code below that uses a method to add "broccoli" to the foods array and
// log the changed array to verify "broccoli" has been added
foods.push("broccoli");
console.log(foods);

// YOU DO: Write code below that removes the last item of food from the foods array and
// log the changed array to verify that item has been removed
foods.pop();
console.log(foods);

// YOU DO: Write code to add 3 new foods to the array.
  // There are several ways to do this - choose whichever you'd like!
foods.push("asparagus", "avocado", "rice");
// Then, log the changed array to verify the new items have been added
console.log(foods);
// YOU DO: Remove the food that is in index position 0.
foods.shift();
console.log(foods);

//-------------------
// PART 3: Where are Arrays used?
//-------------------

/*
Sometimes we need to hold on to multiple pieces of data, but have it grouped together in a list.
This is why programming languages have arrays!

One example of a web/mobile application that uses arrays is Instagram. Each user has a set of posts
associated with their account. Each post, is one of potentially many, that are grouped together in a list,
or, array.

The post itself likely has more complex data, but here's one way we can think about it:
*/

var posts = ["image at beach", "holiday party", "adorable puppy", "video of cute baby"];

// YOU DO: Think of a web application you commonly use. Where do you see LISTS utilized, where arrays
// may be storing data? Come up with 3 examples - they could be from different web applications or
// all from the same one.

// Web App: Discord (similar to Slack, typically used for gaming)
// 1: User lists within servers
// 2: Post history within specific channels
// 3: Reacts + emojis to specific posts


//-------------------
// Part 4: Don't let yourself forget everything from Section 2 of Pre-work
//-------------------

/*
YOU DO:
Using the variables defined below, write a program that will tell a user if they
will be able to call an Uber.

The user can call an uber if they have 15% battery remaining, or more. In this case, it doesn't matter
if the user has a charger at all, or what type.
The can call an uber if they have a charger and it is a car charger.

*/
var percentBatteryLeft = 12;
var hasCharger = true;
var chargerType = "car";

// Write your conditional here
// The function first checks to see if the battery is at 15% or more,
if (percentBatteryLeft >= 15) {
// if so, it goes straight to stating the Uber can be called and stops there.
  console.log("You can call an Uber!");
// If below 15%, the function will then check to see if they have a charger AND if it's a car charger.
} else if (hasCharger === true && chargerType === "car") {
// If the user has a charger, and it's a car charger, the function will print that an Uber can be called.
  console.log("You can call an Uber!");
// If it doesn't meet either of the above "if" statements, then it prints "You can't call an Uber!"
} else {
  console.log("You can't call an Uber!");
}

// YOU DO - ANNOTATE: Above each line of your code for this if statement, create a comment.
// That comment should describe, in your own words, and as technically precise as possible,
// what the line of code below, does.

// MAKE 100% SURE that you have RUN the code in node in your command line, to ensure it works
// as you think it doesðŸŒŸ
