//-------------------
// PART 1: Animals: Array Syntax
//-------------------

// EXAMPLE: write code below that will log an array of animals.
// Store the array in a variable.
var animals = ["Zebra", "Giraffe", "Elephant"];
console.log(animals);

// EXAMPLE: Write code below that will log "Zebra" from the animals array
// YOUR CODE HERE
console.log(animals[0]);

// YOU DO: Write code below that will log the number of elements in array of
// animals from above.
console.log(animals.length);

// YOU DO: Write code that will reassign the last item in the animals
// array to "Gorilla"
animals.push ("Gorilla");

// YOU DO: Write code that will add a new animal (type of your choice) to position 3.
animals[3] = "Dog";

// YOU DO: Write code that will log the String "Elephant" in the animals array
console.log(animals[2]);
console.log(animals)


//-------------------
// PART 2: Foods: Array Methods
//-------------------

// YOU DO: Declare a variable that will store an an array of at least 4 foods (strings)
var foods = ["Mac and Cheese", "Bread", "Apple", "Sour Patch Kids"]

// YOU DO: Write code below that will log the number of elements in the array of
// foods from above.
console.log(foods.length);

// YOU DO: Write code below that uses a method to add "broccoli" to the foods array and
// log the changed array to verify "broccoli" has been added
foods.push ("broccoli");
console.log(foods);
console.log(foods.length);


// YOU DO: Write code below that removes the last item of food from the foods array and
// log the changed array to verify that item has been removed
foods.pop();
console.log(foods);

// YOU DO: Write code to add 3 new foods to the array.
  // There are several ways to do this - choose whichever you'd like!
// Then, log the changed array to verify the new items have been added
foods.push(
  "Banana",
  "Mango",
  "Garlic Bread",
);
console.log(foods);

// YOU DO: Remove the food that is in index position 0.
delete foods[0];
console.log(foods);

//-------------------
// PART 3: Where are Arrays used?
//-------------------

/*
Sometimes we need to hold on to multiple pieces of data, but have it grouped together in a list.
This is why programming languages have arrays!

One example of a web/mobile application that uses arrays is Instagram. Each user has a set of posts
associated with their account. Each post, is one of potentially many, that are grouped together in a list,
or, array.

The post itself likely has more complex data, but here's one way we can think about it:
*/

var posts = ["image at beach", "holiday party", "adorable puppy", "video of cute baby"];

// YOU DO: Think of a web application you commonly use. Where do you see LISTS utilized, where arrays
// may be storing data? Come up with 3 examples - they could be from different web applications or
// all from the same one.

// 1:
// Easiest example I can think of is my email. Although I know it works in a different way with mail servers,
// when organizing it in something like Gmail, I assume this is what is going on. A list of emails is grabbed from
// a database and sent to the client in a understandable viewing medium.
// 2:
// TikTok, I will always come back to TikTok, sorry.. This works the same way as the example above, each account is
// assigned an array of videoIDs, those video IDs translate to a link to a video that generates a thumbnail. These thumbnails
// will show up on the users phone below an account.
// 3:
// I immagine when looking at a video, the video will likely have an array of data as well. There is likely something that records
// the amount of likes, comments and views, each is a integer, so easy to store and manipulate just as you would a regular numbber.

// Part 4: Don't let yourself forget everything from Section 2 of Pre-work
//-------------------

/*
YOU DO:
Using the variables defined below, write a program that will tell a user if they
will be able to call an Uber.

The user can call an uber if they have 15% battery remaining, or more. In this case, it doesn't matter
if the user has a charger at all, or what type.
The can call an uber if they have a charger and it is a car charger.

*/
var percentBatteryLeft = 12;
var hasCharger = true;
var chargerType = "car";

// Write your conditional here
//Set a required battery variable for later changes
var requiredBattery = 15
// In order to minimize code below I wrote messages out as a variable
var sorryMSG = "Sorry, not all conditions are met, You need at least " + requiredBattery + "% battery to use Uber, you only have "+ percentBatteryLeft + "% left unfortunatly";
var callMSG = "All conditions are met!, call an Uber and get home safe!";

//This checks if the users percentBatteryLeft is less than the defined requiredBattery,
if (percentBatteryLeft <= requiredBattery){

  //If less or equal to, sends sorryMSG variable to log
  console.log(sorryMSG);
}
//This will check if the percentBatteryLeft is greater than requiredBattery,
else if (percentBatteryLeft > requiredBattery){
  //log to the console callMSG, telling user they met conditions to call an Uber
  console.log(callMSG);
}

// YOU DO - ANNOTATE: Above each line of your code for this if statement, create a comment.
// That comment should describe, in your own words, and as technically precise as possible,
// what the line of code below, does.

// MAKE 100% SURE that you have RUN the code in node in your command line, to ensure it works
// as you think it doesðŸŒŸ
