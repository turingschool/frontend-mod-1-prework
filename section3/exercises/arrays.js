//-------------------
// PART 1: Animals: Array Syntax
//-------------------

// EXAMPLE: write code below that will log an array of animals.
// Store the array in a variable.
var animals = ["Zebra", "Giraffe", "Elephant"];
console.log(animals);

// EXAMPLE: Write code below that will log "Zebra" from the animals array
// YOUR CODE HERE
console.log(animals[0]);

// YOU DO: Write code below that will log the number of elements in array of
// animals from above.
console.log(animals.length);


// YOU DO: Write code that will reassign the last item in the animals
// array to "Gorilla"
animals[2] = 'Gorilla';
// console.log(animals);

// YOU DO: Write code that will add a new animal (type of your choice) to position 3.
animals.push('Guineafowl');
// console.log(animals);

// YOU DO: Write code that will log the String "Elephant" in the animals array
animals.unshift('Elephant');
// console.log(animals);

//-------------------
// PART 2: Foods: Array Methods
//-------------------

// YOU DO: Declare a variable that will store an an array of at least 4 foods (strings)
var healthyFoods = ["cake", "pie", "turkey leg", "fried chicken"];

// YOU DO: Write code below that will log the number of elements in the array of
// foods from above.
console.log(healthyFoods.length);


// YOU DO: Write code below that uses a method to add "broccoli" to the foods array and
// log the changed array to verify "broccoli" has been added
healthyFoods.push('broccoli');
console.log(healthyFoods);

// YOU DO: Write code below that removes the last item of food from the foods array and
// log the changed array to verify that item has been removed
healthyFoods.pop();
console.log(healthyFoods);


// YOU DO: Write code to add 3 new foods to the array.
  // There are several ways to do this - choose whichever you'd like!
// Then, log the changed array to verify the new items have been added
healthyFoods.unshift("chicken nuggets", "french fries", "pizza");
console.log(healthyFoods);

// YOU DO: Remove the food that is in index position 0.
healthyFoods.shift();
// console.log(healthyFoods);

//-------------------
// PART 3: Where are Arrays used?
//-------------------

/*
Sometimes we need to hold on to multiple pieces of data, but have it grouped together in a list.
This is why programming languages have arrays!

One example of a web/mobile application that uses arrays is Instagram. Each user has a set of posts
associated with their account. Each post, is one of potentially many, that are grouped together in a list,
or, array.

The post itself likely has more complex data, but here's one way we can think about it:
*/

var posts = ["image at beach", "holiday party", "adorable puppy", "video of cute baby"];

// YOU DO: Think of a web application you commonly use. Where do you see LISTS utilized, where arrays
// may be storing data? Come up with 3 examples - they could be from different web applications or
// all from the same one.

// 1: Epicurious has unordered lists for the ingredients that go into a particular recipe. The items in each recipe's list
//could be stored in an array.
// 2: The Boston Marathon registration wesbiste can give you the results of your overall finishing placement (i.e. finished 3rd out of 25,831 people).
//one method for getting this placeent would be when the rfid on your anke/wrist is logged at the finish line--your finishing placement could be automatically
//thrown into an array in chronological order. This list could then generate a list of finishing time in order by taking the array index of your bib number and
//then adding 1 to it for display to the public. (this is probably better suited to an object to include name, but bib number is as good as name, RIGHT?!)
// 3: Instagram has a list called "Close Friends" which allows you to create a personalized list of people that is an option for sharing stories or posts with
//rather than sharing to everyone you are friends with on instagram. I imagine this is kept in an array, no need for a particular order (unordered list)as they
//are all going to be granted access to your post at the same time.

// Part 4: Don't let yourself forget everything from Section 2 of Pre-work
//-------------------

/*
YOU DO:
Using the variables defined below, write a program that will tell a user if they
will be able to call an Uber.

The user can call an uber if they have 15% battery remaining, or more. In this case, it doesn't matter
if the user has a charger at all, or what type.
The can call an uber if they have a charger and it is a car charger.

*/
var percentBatteryLeft = 12;
var hasCharger = true;
var chargerType = "car";

// Create an if statement that checks for two differing conditions using the OR logical operator:
  //condition 1: is percentBatteryLeft variable greater than or equal to 15 percentBatteryLeft
  //condition 2: is the percentBatteryLeft variable less than 15 AND (use logical operator) is the hasCharger variable equal to the "true" boolean AND
  //the chargerType variable equal to "car"
if(percentBatteryLeft >= 15 || percentBatteryLeft < 15 && hasCharger === true && chargerType === "car") {
  //if condition 1 logs to true OR condition 2 logs to true then console to the log "The user may call an uber!"
  console.log("The user may call an uber!");
} else {
  //for any other condition, which indicates that the percent battery life is below 15 percent and the user either has a charger that is not a car charger,
  //or has no charger at all, log to the console "The user may not call an uber, sorry!"
  console.log("The user may not call an uber, sorry!");
}


// YOU DO - ANNOTATE: Above each line of your code for this if statement, create a comment.
// That comment should describe, in your own words, and as technically precise as possible,
// what the line of code below, does.

// MAKE 100% SURE that you have RUN the code in node in your command line, to ensure it works
// as you think it doesðŸŒŸ
