//-------------------
// PART 1: Animals: Array Syntax
//-------------------

// EXAMPLE: write code below that will log an array of animals.
// Store the array in a variable.
var animals = ["Zebra", "Giraffe", "Elephant"];
console.log(animals);

// EXAMPLE: Write code below that will log "Zebra" from the animals array
// YOUR CODE HERE
console.log(animals[0]);

// YOU DO: Write code below that will log the number of elements in array of
// animals from above.
console.log(animals.length);


// YOU DO: Write code that will reassign the last item in the animals
// array to "Gorilla"

animals[2] = "Gorilla";
console.log (animals);

// YOU DO: Write code that will add a new animal (type of your choice) to position 3.

animals[3] = "Tiger";
console.log (animals);

// YOU DO: Write code that will log the String "Elephant" in the animals array

animals[4] = "Elephant";
console.log (animals);

//-------------------
// PART 2: Foods: Array Methods
//-------------------

// YOU DO: Declare a variable that will store an array of at least 4 foods (strings)
var shoppingList = ["apples", "grapes", "oranges", "milk"];

// YOU DO: Write code below that will log the number of elements in the array of
// foods from above.
console.log (shoppingList.length);

// YOU DO: Write code below that uses a method to add "broccoli" to the foods array and
// log the changed array to verify "broccoli" has been added
shoppingList.push("broccoli");
console.log(shoppingList);

// YOU DO: Write code below that removes the last item of food from the foods array and
// log the changed array to verify that item has been removed
shoppingList.pop();
console.log(shoppingList);

// YOU DO: Write code to add 3 new foods to the array.
  // There are several ways to do this - choose whichever you'd like!
// Then, log the changed array to verify the new items have been added
shoppingList.push("cereal", "yogurt", "chocolate");
console.log(shoppingList);

// YOU DO: Remove the food that is in index position 0.
shoppingList.shift()
console.log(shoppingList);

//-------------------
// PART 3: Where are Arrays used?
//-------------------

/*
Sometimes we need to hold on to multiple pieces of data, but have it grouped together in a list.
This is why programming languages have arrays!

One example of a web/mobile application that uses arrays is Instagram. Each user has a set of posts
associated with their account. Each post, is one of potentially many, that are grouped together in a list,
or, array.

The post itself likely has more complex data, but here's one way we can think about it:
*/

var posts = ["image at beach", "holiday party", "adorable puppy", "video of cute baby"];

// YOU DO: Think of a web application you commonly use. Where do you see LISTS utilized, where arrays
// may be storing data? Come up with 3 examples - they could be from different web applications or
// all from the same one.

// 1: list of workouts completed on Strava
// 2: My Turing Pre Work to do list on the Todoist App
// 3: List of documents in a Google Docs folder


//-------------------
// Part 4: Don't let yourself forget everything from Section 2 of Pre-work
//-------------------

/*
YOU DO:
Using the variables defined below, write a program that will tell a user if they
will be able to call an Uber.

The user can call an uber if they have 15% battery remaining, or more. In this case, it doesn't matter
if the user has a charger at all, or what type.
The can call an uber if they have a charger and it is a car charger.

*/
// Write your conditional here

var percentBatteryLeft = 12;
var hasCharger = true;
var chargerType = "car";

//With the three variables there are three situations the user could be in. They could have 15% charge or greater and thus can call an Uber without charger. They could have less than 15% but have a charger that is a car charger (two seperate conditions). They could have less than 15% an not have a charger or they have a charger and its not a home charger. This first if statement covers the first situation.
if (percentBatteryLeft >= 15) {
//If the above condition is true then they can call uber and this message declares that.
  console.log("Let's call an Uber!");
//This conidition only happens if the above is false (their battery is below 15%). If they have charger and its a car charger then they can call an uber. The && creates this conidition in which both must be tru for the following code to run.
} else if (hasCharger == true && chargerType == "car")  {
//If both conditions of having a charger and its s car charger are true then this string telling the user they can call an Uber runs.
  console.log("Let's call an Uber!");
//The last conidtional occurs only if one of the previous two conditions are not met.
} else{
//This logs the message that they must either meet one of the two if or else if conditional statements above to change this outcome. This code potentially does not cover edge cases. This is worth further exploring.
  console.log("Sorry please charge battery to 15% or plug phone into a car charger to be able to call an Uber");
}

// YOU DO - ANNOTATE: Above each line of your code for this if statement, create a comment.
// That comment should describe, in your own words, and as technically precise as possible,
// what the line of code below, does.

// MAKE 100% SURE that you have RUN the code in node in your command line, to ensure it works
// as you think it doesðŸŒŸ
