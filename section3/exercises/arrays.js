Two examples are already completed. Your task is to complete

//-------------------
// PART 1: Animals: Array Syntax
//-------------------

// EXAMPLE: write code below that will log an array of animals.
// Store the array in a variable.
var animals = ["Zebra", "Giraffe", "Elephant"];
console.log(animals);

// EXAMPLE: Write code below that will log "Zebra" from the animals array
// YOUR CODE HERE
console.log(animals[0]);

// YOU DO: Write code below that will log the number of elements in array of
// animals from above.
console.log(animals.length);


// YOU DO: Write code that will reassign the last item in the animals
// array to "Gorilla"
console.log(animals[2]= "Gorilla");

// YOU DO: Write code that will add a new animal (type of your choice) to position 3.

animals.push("Tiger");
console.log(animals);
//console.log(animals + " , " + "Tiger"); // this is another way to add a string (I THINK)

// YOU DO: Write code that will log the String "Elephant" in the animals array
console.log(animals[4]= "Elephant");
console.log(animals);
//-------------------
// PART 2: Foods: Array Methods
//-------------------

// YOU DO: Declare a variable that will store an an array of at least 4 foods (strings)
var food = ["Pasta", "Tacos", "Pho", "Ramen"];

// YOU DO: Write code below that will log the number of elements in the array of
// foods from above.
  console.log(food.length);

// YOU DO: Write code below that uses a method to add "broccoli" to the foods array and
// log the changed array to verify "broccoli" has been added
food.push("broccoli");
  console.log(food);
// YOU DO: Write code below that removes the last item of food from the foods array and
// log the changed array to verify that item has been removed
food.pop();
  console.log(food);

food.splice(0 , 1); // this is a more specific way of removing an item from an array
  //console.log(food);
// YOU DO: Write code to add 3 new foods to the array.
  // There are several ways to do this - choose whichever you'd like!
// Then, log the changed array to verify the new items have been added
food.push("Sushi", "Thai", "Pizza");

  console.log(food);
  console.log(food.length);
// YOU DO: Remove the food that is in index position 0.
food.shift();
  console.log(food);
//-------------------
// PART 3: Where are Arrays used?
//-------------------

/*
Sometimes we need to hold on to multiple pieces of data, but have it grouped together in a list.
This is why programming languages have arrays!

One example of a web/mobile application that uses arrays is Instagram. Each user has a set of posts
associated with their account. Each post, is one of potentially many, that are grouped together in a list,
or, array.

The post itself likely has more complex data, but here's one way we can think about it:
*/

var posts = ["image at beach", "holiday party", "adorable puppy", "video of cute baby"];

// YOU DO: Think of a web application you commonly use. Where do you see LISTS utilized, where arrays
// may be storing data? Come up with 3 examples - they could be from different web applications or
// all from the same one.

// 1:Amazon
var accountOptions = ["Your Orders", "Buy Again", "Your Lists", "Your Account"];
// 2:Facebook
 var photos = ["Albums", "Photos of you", "Uploads", "Videos"];
// 3:UsBank
var accounts = ["Checking", "Savings", "Credit Card"];

// Part 4: Don't let yourself forget everything from Section 2 of Pre-work
//-------------------

/*
YOU DO:
Using the variables defined below, write a program that will tell a user if they
will be able to call an Uber.

The user can call an uber if they have 15% battery remaining, or more. In this case, it doesn't matter
if the user has a charger at all, or what type.
They can call an uber if they have a charger and it is a car charger.

*/
var percentBatteryLeft = 18;
var hasCharger = false;
var chargerType = "house";

// Write your conditional here
//if this condition is met the you can call an uber
if (percentBatteryLeft >= 15){
  console.log("Call an Uber");
}// if fisrt condition isnt met and this one is met you can call an uber
  else if(percentBatteryLeft >= 14 && hasCharger == true && chargerType == "car"){
  console.log("Call an Uber");
} // if the above conditions aren't met and this one is, you dont have enough battery to call an Uber
else if (percentBatteryLeft <= 14 && hasCharger == false) {
  console.log("Can't call an Uber");
} // if this condition is met, then you still can't call an uber because the variables dont meet the conitions being presented.
else if(percentBatteryLeft <= 14 && hasCharger == true && chargerType == "house"){
  console.log("Can't call an Uber");
}
//else{
  //console.log("cant call an Uber");
//}
// YOU DO - ANNOTATE: Above each line of your code for this if statement, create a comment.
// That comment should describe, in your own words, and as technically precise as possible,
// what the line of code below, does.

// MAKE 100% SURE that you have RUN the code in node in your command line, to ensure it works
// as you think it doesðŸŒŸ
