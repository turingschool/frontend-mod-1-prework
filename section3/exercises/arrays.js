//-------------------
// PART 1: Animals: Array Syntax
//-------------------

// EXAMPLE: write code below that will log an array of animals.
// Store the array in a variable.
var animals = ["Zebra", "Giraffe", "Elephant"];
console.log(animals);

// EXAMPLE: Write code below that will log "Zebra" from the animals array
// YOUR CODE HERE
console.log(animals[0]);

// YOU DO: Write code below that will log the number of elements in array of
// animals from above.
console.log(animals.length);

// YOU DO: Write code that will reassign the last item in the animals
// array to "Gorilla"
animals.splice(2,1,"Gorilla");
console.log(animals);

// YOU DO: Write code that will add a new animal (type of your choice) to position 3.
animals.push("Goat");
console.log(animals);

// YOU DO: Write code that will log the String "Elephant" in the animals array
animals.unshift("Elephant");
console.log(animals[0]);

//-------------------
// PART 2: Foods: Array Methods
//-------------------

// YOU DO: Declare a variable that will store an an array of at least 4 foods (strings)
var foods = ["Pizza", "Bread", "Pasta", "Strawberry"];
//console.log(foods);

// YOU DO: Write code below that will log the number of elements in the array of
// foods from above.
console.log(foods.length);

// YOU DO: Write code below that uses a method to add "broccoli" to the foods array and
// log the changed array to verify "broccoli" has been added
foods.push("broccoli");
console.log(foods);


// YOU DO: Write code below that removes the last item of food from the foods array and
// log the changed array to verify that item has been removed
foods.pop();
console.log(foods);

// YOU DO: Write code to add 3 new foods to the array.
  // There are several ways to do this - choose whichever you'd like!
// Then, log the changed array to verify the new items have been added
foods.splice(1,0,"Saag", "Carrot", "Cheese");
console.log(foods);

// YOU DO: Remove the food that is in index position 0.
foods.shift();
//console.log(foods);

//-------------------
// PART 3: Where are Arrays used?
//-------------------

/*
Sometimes we need to hold on to multiple pieces of data, but have it grouped together in a list.
This is why programming languages have arrays!

One example of a web/mobile application that uses arrays is Instagram. Each user has a set of posts
associated with their account. Each post, is one of potentially many, that are grouped together in a list,
or, array.

The post itself likely has more complex data, but here's one way we can think about it:
*/

var posts = ["image at beach", "holiday party", "adorable puppy", "video of cute baby"];

// YOU DO: Think of a web application you commonly use. Where do you see LISTS utilized, where arrays
// may be storing data? Come up with 3 examples - they could be from different web applications or
// all from the same one.

// 1: Youtube: Videos in a playlist may be in an array
// 2: Spotify: Songs are arranged in albums or playlists that are likely arrays
// 3: Skillshare: Videos in a playlist for certain topics

// Part 4: Don't let yourself forget everything from Section 2 of Pre-work
//-------------------

/*
YOU DO:
Using the variables defined below, write a program that will tell a user if they
will be able to call an Uber.

The user can call an uber if they have 15% battery remaining, or more. In this case, it doesn't matter
if the user has a charger at all, or what type.
The can call an uber if they have a charger and it is a car charger.

*/
var percentBatteryLeft = 15;
var hasCharger = false;
var chargerType = "car";

// Write your conditional here
// Conditional evaluates if variable percentBatteryLeft is greater than or equal to 15
if (percentBatteryLeft >= 15){
// If true the program reterns "You can call an uber", if false skip this code block
  console.log("You can call an uber");
// Conditional evaluates if both variable hasCharger is true and if variable chargerType is exactly equal
// to "car"
}else if (hasCharger && chargerType == "car"){
// If true the program reterns "You can call an uber", if false skip this code block
  console.log("You can call an uber");
// If neither of the previous conditionals evaluate true
}else {
// Program returns "You can not call an uber"
  console.log("You can not call an uber");
}

// YOU DO - ANNOTATE: Above each line of your code for this if statement, create a comment.
// That comment should describe, in your own words, and as technically precise as possible,
// what the line of code below, does.

// MAKE 100% SURE that you have RUN the code in node in your command line, to ensure it works
// as you think it doesðŸŒŸ
