//-------------------
// PART 1: Animals: Array Syntax
//-------------------

// EXAMPLE: write code below that will log an array of animals.
// Store the array in a variable.
var animals = ["Zebra", "Giraffe", "Elephant"];
console.log(animals);

// EXAMPLE: Write code below that will log "Zebra" from the animals array
// YOUR CODE HERE
console.log(animals[0]);

// YOU DO: Write code below that will log the number of elements in array of
// animals from above.
console.log(animals.length); //3

// YOU DO: Write code that will reassign the last item in the animals
// array to "Gorilla

// Since I know the length is 3 from above I can write fixed code as such
animals[2] = "Gorilla";
console.log(animals[2]);

/*console.log("NOTE TO REVIEWER: I also considered the following code because I ")
console.log("might not always know the array length or I might want the code to ")
console.log("be flexibile enough to figure it out")*/

animals[animals.length-1] = "Monkey";
console.log(animals[animals.length - 1]);


// YOU DO: Write code that will add a new animal (type of your choice) to position 3.

//position 3 is actually index 2
animals[2] = "Snake";
console.log(animals[2]);

// YOU DO: Write code that will log the String "Elephant" in the animals array

// add Elephant back to the last position then log it
animals[2] = "Elephant";
console.log(animals[2]);

//-------------------
// PART 2: Foods: Array Methods
//-------------------

// YOU DO: Declare a variable that will store an an array of at least 4 foods (strings)
var foods = ["apple", "orange", "grapes", "berries"];

// YOU DO: Write code below that will log the number of elements in the array of
// foods from above.
console.log(foods.length);

// YOU DO: Write code below that uses a method to add "broccoli" to the foods array and
// log the changed array to verify "broccoli" has been added
foods.push("broccoli");
console.log(foods)

// YOU DO: Write code below that removes the last item of food from the foods array and
// log the changed array to verify that item has been removed
foods.pop()
console.log(foods)

// YOU DO: Write code to add 3 new foods to the array.
  // There are several ways to do this - choose whichever you'd like!
// Then, log the changed array to verify the new items have been added
foods.push("tomato", "lettuce", "kale");
console.log(foods);

// YOU DO: Remove the food that is in index position 0.
foods.shift();
console.log(foods);

//-------------------
// PART 3: Where are Arrays used?
//-------------------

/*
Sometimes we need to hold on to multiple pieces of data, but have it grouped together in a list.
This is why programming languages have arrays!

One example of a web/mobile application that uses arrays is Instagram. Each user has a set of posts
associated with their account. Each post, is one of potentially many, that are grouped together in a list,
or, array.

The post itself likely has more complex data, but here's one way we can think about it:
*/

var posts = ["image at beach", "holiday party", "adorable puppy", "video of cute baby"];

// YOU DO: Think of a web application you commonly use. Where do you see LISTS utilized, where arrays
// may be storing data? Come up with 3 examples - they could be from different web applications or
// all from the same one.

// 1: silvercar.com car rental website: storing rental locations in an array e.g. ["Austin", "Miami", "Boston"]
// 2: silvercar.com car rental website: storing different car types e.g. ("Audi A4", "Audi Q5", "Audi Q7")
// 3: silvercar.com car rental website: storing different price points e.g. floats (59.99, 69.99, 79.99)

// Part 4: Don't let yourself forget everything from Section 2 of Pre-work
//-------------------

/*
YOU DO:
Using the variables defined below, write a program that will tell a user if they
will be able to call an Uber.

The user can call an uber if they have 15% battery remaining, or more. In this case, it doesn't matter
if the user has a charger at all, or what type.
The can call an uber if they have a charger and it is a car charger.

*/
var percentBatteryLeft = 12;
var hasCharger = true;
var chargerType = "car";

// Write your conditional here
/* Creates variable to evaluate (a) if percentBatteryLeft >=15 true then given logical conditional
or statement ensures they can call an Uber. Or if they have a charger = true and it's a car charge
is strictly equal to "car"*/
var canCallUber = percentBatteryLeft >= 15 || (hasCharger && chargerType === "car")
//console.log(canCallUber); //true, used to quality control the results of the canCallUber variable

//if canCallUber = true
if (canCallUber) {
//if canCallUber = true, tell user they can call uber
  console.log("You can call an Uber!!");
} else {
// if canCallUber if false, tell user they can not call an uber
  console.log("I'm sorry. You don't have enough battery life to call an Uber");
}

// YOU DO - ANNOTATE: Above each line of your code for this if statement, create a comment.
// That comment should describe, in your own words, and as technically precise as possible,
// what the line of code below, does.

// MAKE 100% SURE that you have RUN the code in node in your command line, to ensure it works
// as you think it doesðŸŒŸ
