//-------------------
// PART 1: Animals: Array Syntax
//-------------------

// EXAMPLE: write code below that will log an array of animals.
// Store the array in a variable.
var animals = ["Zebra", "Giraffe", "Elephant"];
console.log(animals);

// EXAMPLE: Write code below that will log "Zebra" from the animals array
// YOUR CODE HERE
console.log(animals[0]);

// YOU DO: Write code below that will log the number of elements in array of
// animals from above.
console.log(animals.length);

// YOU DO: Write code that will reassign the last item in the animals
// array to "Gorilla"
animals.pop();
animals.push("Gorilla");
console.log(animals);
//Question for feedback - this technically isn't reassigning since I deleted the
//end with pop and pushed a new element to the end. Is this what you are looking
//for? Or is there a different function I need to be calling here?

// YOU DO: Write code that will add a new animal (type of your choice) to position 3.
animals.push("Monkey");
console.log(animals);

// YOU DO: Write code that will log the String "Elephant" in the animals array
//Reassigning animals to the original array.
var animals = ["Zebra", "Giraffe", "Elephant"];
console.log(animals[2]);

//-------------------
// PART 2: Foods: Array Methods
//-------------------

// YOU DO: Declare a variable that will store an an array of at least 4 foods (strings)
var food = ["bread", "rice", "orange", "carrot"]

// YOU DO: Write code below that will log the number of elements in the array of
// foods from above.
console.log(food.length);

// YOU DO: Write code below that uses a method to add "broccoli" to the foods array and
food.push("broccoli");
// log the changed array to verify "broccoli" has been added
console.log(food);


// YOU DO: Write code below that removes the last item of food from the foods array and
food.pop();
// log the changed array to verify that item has been removed
console.log(food);


// YOU DO: Write code to add 3 new foods to the array.
  // There are several ways to do this - choose whichever you'd like!
food.push("potato", "gummy", "cereal")
// Then, log the changed array to verify the new items have been added
console.log(food);
// YOU DO: Remove the food that is in index position 0.
food.splice(0,1);
console.log(food);

//-------------------
// PART 3: Where are Arrays used?
//-------------------

/*
Sometimes we need to hold on to multiple pieces of data, but have it grouped together in a list.
This is why programming languages have arrays!

One example of a web/mobile application that uses arrays is Instagram. Each user has a set of posts
associated with their account. Each post, is one of potentially many, that are grouped together in a list,
or, array.

The post itself likely has more complex data, but here's one way we can think about it:
*/

var posts = ["image at beach", "holiday party", "adorable puppy", "video of cute baby"];

// YOU DO: Think of a web application you commonly use. Where do you see LISTS utilized, where arrays
// may be storing data? Come up with 3 examples - they could be from different web applications or
// all from the same one.

// 1: Amazon shopping cart
var cart = ["Toothpaste", "Toothbrush", "Floss"]
// 2: Doordash list of resturaunts in my area
var localResturaunts = ["Maria's Taqueria", "Rise Pies", "Difranco's"]
// 3: Google Maps list of directions
var directions = ["Turn left in 500 feet", "Continue for 1 mile", "Turn right",
"Destination in 300 feet on the right"]

// Part 4: Don't let yourself forget everything from Section 2 of Pre-work
//-------------------

/*
YOU DO:
Using the variables defined below, write a program that will tell a user if they
will be able to call an Uber.

The user can call an uber if they have 15% battery remaining, or more. In this case, it doesn't matter
if the user has a charger at all, or what type.
The can call an uber if they have a charger and it is a car charger.

*/

//Creating a new variable called percentBatteryLeft and assigning it a
//value of the number 12.
var percentBatteryLeft = 12;
//Creating a new variable called hasCharger and assigning it to the
//boolean value of true.
var hasCharger = true;
//Creating a new variable called chargerType and assigning it to the string
//value "car".
var chargerType = "car";

// Write your conditional here
// If the value of percentBatteryLeft is greater than 15, log the console
// with the message "You are able to call an Uber". If the value is less than
// 15 the code will not log this message, and will move onto the else if
// argument in the code.
if (percentBatteryLeft > 15) {
  console.log("You are able to call an Uber");
//If the variable has charger is equal to true and the value of the variable
//chargerType is equal to the string "car", then log the following message
//to the console: "You are able to call an Uber".
} else if (hasCharger == true && chargerType == "car") {
  console.log("You are able to call an Uber");
}
//If the conditions for the previous lines of code were not met, then
//log the following message to the console:
// "You are unable to call an Uber until you charge your phone to
// fifteen percent or bring car charger."
  else {
  console.log("You are unable to call an Uber until you charge your phone to fifteen percent or bring car charger.");
}


// YOU DO - ANNOTATE: Above each line of your code for this if statement, create a comment.
// That comment should describe, in your own words, and as technically precise as possible,
// what the line of code below, does.

// MAKE 100% SURE that you have RUN the code in node in your command line, to ensure it works
// as you think it doesðŸŒŸ
