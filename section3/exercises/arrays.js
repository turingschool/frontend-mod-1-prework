Two examples are already completed. Your task is to complete
any remaining prompt.

//-------------------
// PART 1: Animals: Array Syntax
//-------------------

// EXAMPLE: write code below that will log an array of animals.
// Store the array in a variable.
var animals = ["Zebra", "Giraffe", "Elephant"];
console.log(animals);
// will log ["Zebra", "Giraffe", "Elephant"]


// EXAMPLE: Write code below that will log "Zebra" from the animals array
// YOUR CODE HERE
console.log(animals[0]);
// will log "Zebra"

// YOU DO: Write code below that will log the number of elements in array of
// animals from above.
console.log(animals.length);
//Will log 3

// YOU DO: Write code that will reassign the last item in the animals
// array to "Gorilla"
animals[2]="Gorilla";
// Will replace "Elephant" (the last item) with "Gorilla"


// YOU DO: Write code that will add a new animal (type of your choice) to position 3.
animals.push("Chihuahua");
// Will add "Chihuahua" at the end of the array

// YOU DO: Write code that will log the String "Elephant" in the animals array
//console.log();

// Elephant should have been replaced with "Gorilla" at line 35, Here I added back in elephant in order to log the string "Elephant"
animals.push("elephant");
console.log(animals[4])


//-------------------
// PART 2: Foods: Array Methods
//-------------------

// YOU DO: Declare a variable that will store an an array of at least 4 foods (strings)
var foods = ["pizza", "ramen", "saurkraut", "gummybears"];

// YOU DO: Write code below that will log the number of elements in the array of
// foods from above.
console.log(foods.length);


// YOU DO: Write code below that uses a method to add "broccoli" to the foods array and
// log the changed array to verify "broccoli" has been added
foods.unshift("broccoli");
console.log(foods);

// YOU DO: Write code below that removes the last item of food from the foods array and
// log the changed array to verify that item has been removed
foods.pop();
console.log(foods);

// YOU DO: Write code to add 3 new foods to the array.
  // There are several ways to do this - choose whichever you'd like!
// Then, log the changed array to verify the new items have been added
foods.push("kiwi", "lemon", "sandwitch");
console.log(foods);
// YOU DO: Remove the food that is in index position 0.
foods.shift();
console.log(foods);
//-------------------
// PART 3: Where are Arrays used?
//-------------------

/*
Sometimes we need to hold on to multiple pieces of data, but have it grouped together in a list.
This is why programming languages have arrays!

One example of a web/mobile application that uses arrays is Instagram. Each user has a set of posts
associated with their account. Each post, is one of potentially many, that are grouped together in a list,
or, array.

The post itself likely has more complex data, but here's one way we can think about it:
*/

var posts = ["image at beach", "holiday party", "adorable puppy", "video of cute baby"];

// YOU DO: Think of a web application you commonly use. Where do you see LISTS utilized, where arrays
// may be storing data? Come up with 3 examples - they could be from different web applications or
// all from the same one.

// 1:AirBNB - each listing has a set of data in an arrays that describes what the space has
// 2:AirBNB - each search has a set of data in an array that describes what is desired in the space
// 3:PetFinders - each listings has a set of tata in an array that describes the pet so people can find the right pet for them.

// Part 4: Don't let yourself forget everything from Section 2 of Pre-work
//-------------------

/*
YOU DO:
Using the variables defined below, write a program that will tell a user if they
will be able to call an Uber.

The user can call an uber if they have 15% battery remaining, or more. In this case, it doesn't matter
if the user has a charger at all, or what type.
The can call an uber if they have a charger and it is a car charger.

*/
var percentBatteryLeft = 12;
var hasCharger = true;
var chargerType = "car";

// Write your conditional here

//Block of code executing if condition is true (if percentBatteryLeft is greater than 15). If true, it will log "can call uber".
//If false will move to next condition
if (percentBatteryLeft >= 15) {
  console.log("Can call Uber")
// Block of code executing if condition is true (if hasCharger is true AND chargerType is Car). If true, it will log, "also can call uber"
//If false will move on to the next condition
} else if (hasCharger === true && chargerType === "car" ){
  console.log("also can call uber");
}
//Block of code that will execute if the previous conditions are not true. Will log "cannot call Uber"
else {
  console.log("cannot call Uber");
}


// YOU DO - ANNOTATE: Above each line of your code for this if statement, create a comment.
// That comment should describe, in your own words, and as technically precise as possible,
// what the line of code below, does.

// MAKE 100% SURE that you have RUN the code in node in your command line, to ensure it works
// as you think it doesðŸŒŸ
