//-------------------
// PART 1: Animals: Array Syntax
//-------------------

// EXAMPLE: write code below that will log an array of animals.
// Store the array in a variable.
var animals = ["Zebra", "Giraffe", "Elephant"];
console.log(animals);

// EXAMPLE: Write code below that will log "Zebra" from the animals array
// YOUR CODE HERE
console.log(animals[0]);

// YOU DO: Write code below that will log the number of elements in array of
// animals from above.
console.log(animals.length);

// YOU DO: Write code that will reassign the last item in the animals
// array to "Gorilla"
console.log(animals);
animals[2]= "Gorilla";
console.log(animals);


// YOU DO: Write code that will add a new animal (type of your choice) to position 3.
addAnimal = animals.push('Lion');
console.log(animals);

// YOU DO: Write code that will log the String "Elephant" in the animals array
addAnotherAnimal=animals.push('Elephant');
console.log(animals);
console.log(addAnotherAnimal);


//-------------------
// PART 2: Foods: Array Methods
//-------------------

// YOU DO: Declare a variable that will store an an array of at least 4 foods (strings)
var foods = ['Apples', 'Cucumbers', 'Kale', 'Bread'];
console.log(foods);


// YOU DO: Write code below that will log the number of elements in the array of
// foods from above.
console.log(foods.length);


// YOU DO: Write code below that uses a method to add "broccoli" to the foods array and
// log the changed array to verify "broccoli" has been added
addFood = foods.push('Broccoli');
console.log(foods);

// YOU DO: Write code below that removes the last item of food from the foods array and
// log the changed array to verify that item has been removed
popped = foods.pop();
console.log(popped);
console.log(foods);

// YOU DO: Write code to add 3 new foods to the array.
  // There are several ways to do this - choose whichever you'd like!
// Then, log the changed array to verify the new items have been added
addFoods =foods.push('Watermelon', 'Pears', 'Ice cream');
console.log(foods);
console.log(addFoods);

// YOU DO: Remove the food that is in index position 0.
firstElement = foods.shift();
console.log(foods);

//-------------------
// PART 3: Where are Arrays used?
//-------------------

/*
Sometimes we need to hold on to multiple pieces of data, but have it grouped together in a list.
This is why programming languages have arrays!

One example of a web/mobile application that uses arrays is Instagram. Each user has a set of posts
associated with their account. Each post, is one of potentially many, that are grouped together in a list,
or, array.

The post itself likely has more complex data, but here's one way we can think about it:
*/

var posts = ["image at beach", "holiday party", "adorable puppy", "video of cute baby"];

// YOU DO: Think of a web application you commonly use. Where do you see LISTS utilized, where arrays
// may be storing data? Come up with 3 examples - they could be from different web applications or
// all from the same one.

// 1: Schoology: var schoologyCourse = ['assignments', 'calendar', 'posts'];
// 2: Google drive: var googleDocs = ['blank document', 'templates', 'edit history'];
// 3: Gmail: var gmail = ['credentials', 'user image', 'google logo'];


//-------------------
// Part 4: Don't let yourself forget everything from Section 2 of Pre-work
//-------------------

/*
YOU DO:
Using the variables defined below, write a program that will tell a user if they
will be able to call an Uber.

The user can call an uber if they have 15% battery remaining, or more. In this case, it doesn't matter
if the user has a charger at all, or what type.
The can call an uber if they have a charger and it is a car charger.

*/
var percentBatteryLeft = 12;
var hasCharger = true;
var chargerType = "car";


// Write your conditional here
// this conditional below could only be met if the variable about battery percent was strict equality to meet the condition.
//Because this condition cannot be met, the next conditional code must be read to see if it can be executed.
  if (percentBatteryLeft === 15) {
    console.log("cannot call an uber");
//the below conditional would need to be met by the battery percent equals to or is great than 15% and if so, the condition would allow calling an uber.
  } else if (percentBatteryLeft >= 15) {
      console.log("can call an uber");
} //this line of code is stating that if the battery (variable decalred) is below 15%  (using a number) which
//is shown given that it is at 12%, there cannot be an uber called. The line of code
// checks to see if the percentBatteryLeft is strictly equal to the condition set, but the condition cannot meet it because it is less than 15.
//In this case, the condition is not strictly equal to the amount of battery needed,
//therefore there would not be a way to call an uber so the if statement cannot meet the conditions.
 else if (hasCharger === true && chargerType === "car") {
//Because the conditions can be met, despite the fact that the battery is below 15%, then an uber can be called succesfully as the output when the console.log is run.
  console.log("can call an uber");
}
//finally if the above conditions were not met, then



    //block of code executes if condition1 evaluates to true
    //block of code executes if condition1 evaluates to false and condition2 evaluates to true.
    //block of code executes if condition1 and condition2 evaluate to false
    //and condition3 evaluates to true.
    //block of code executes if none of the conditions above evaluate to true.


// YOU DO - ANNOTATE: Above each line of your code for this if statement, create a comment.
// That comment should describe, in your own words, and as technically precise as possible,
// what the line of code below, does.

// MAKE 100% SURE that you have RUN the code in node in your command line, to ensure it works
// as you think it doesðŸŒŸ
