//-------------------
// PART 1: Animals: Array Syntax
//-------------------

// EXAMPLE: write code below that will log an array of animals.
// Store the array in a variable.
var animals = ["Zebra", "Giraffe", "Elephant"];
console.log(animals);

// EXAMPLE: Write code below that will log "Zebra" from the animals array
// YOUR CODE HERE
console.log(animals[0]);

// YOU DO: Write code below that will log the number of elements in array of
// animals from above.
var animalCount = animals.length;
console.log(animalCount);

// YOU DO: Write code that will reassign the last item in the animals
// array to "Gorilla"
animals[2] = "Gorilla";

// YOU DO: Write code that will add a new animal (type of your choice) to position 3.
animals[3] = "Lemur";

// YOU DO: Write code that will log the String "Elephant" in the animals array
animals[4] = "Elephant";
console.log(animals[4]);

console.log(animals);
console.log("End of Part 1");


//-------------------
// PART 2: Foods: Array Methods
//-------------------

// YOU DO: Declare a variable that will store an an array of at least 4 foods (strings)
var snacks = ['apple', 'chips', 'trail mix', 'grapes'];

// YOU DO: Write code below that will log the number of elements in the array of
// foods from above.
console.log(snacks.length);

// YOU DO: Write code below that uses a method to add "broccoli" to the foods array and
// log the changed array to verify "broccoli" has been added

snacks.push("broccoli");
console.log(snacks);

// YOU DO: Write code below that removes the last item of food from the foods array and
// log the changed array to verify that item has been removed
snacks.pop();
console.log(snacks);

// YOU DO: Write code to add 3 new foods to the array.
  // There are several ways to do this - choose whichever you'd like!
// Then, log the changed array to verify the new items have been added
snacks.push('cold pizza', 'PB&J', 'carrots');
console.log(snacks);

// YOU DO: Remove the food that is in index position 0.
snacks.shift();
console.log(snacks);
console.log("End of Part 2");
//-------------------
// PART 3: Where are Arrays used?
//-------------------

/*
Sometimes we need to hold on to multiple pieces of data, but have it grouped together in a list.
This is why programming languages have arrays!

One example of a web/mobile application that uses arrays is Instagram. Each user has a set of posts
associated with their account. Each post, is one of potentially many, that are grouped together in a list,
or, array.

The post itself likely has more complex data, but here's one way we can think about it:
*/

var posts = ["image at beach", "holiday party", "adorable puppy", "video of cute baby"];

// YOU DO: Think of a web application you commonly use. Where do you see LISTS utilized, where arrays
// may be storing data? Come up with 3 examples - they could be from different web applications or
// all from the same one.

// 1: Shopping cart on Amazon might use array to store items together for purchase.
// 2: Recently viewed items on Amazon might be populated in an array.
// 3: When Amazon provides a list of similar items to the one you're viewing, they could be stored in an array.

// Part 4: Don't let yourself forget everything from Section 2 of Pre-work
//-------------------

/*
YOU DO:
Using the variables defined below, write a program that will tell a user if they
will be able to call an Uber.

The user can call an uber if they have 15% battery remaining, or more. In this case, it doesn't matter
if the user has a charger at all, or what type.
The can call an uber if they have a charger and it is a car charger.

*/
var percentBatteryLeft = 12;
var hasCharger = true;
var chargerType = "car";

// Write your conditional here
// This conditional statement will check whether percentBatteryLeft is less than
// 15 and if hasCharger is true and if chargerType is "car".
if (percentBatteryLeft < 15 && hasCharger === true && chargerType === "car") {
// If all three of those conditions above are true, it will log the next line as written.
  console.log("You can call an Uber if you charge in the car.");
// Otherwise, it will check the next line to see if percentBatteryLeft is greater
//than or equal to 15...
} else if (percentBatteryLeft >= 15) {
// If this condition above is met, it will log the following line
  console.log("You have enough battery to call an Uber!");
//Finally, if neither the first if or else if conditions are true, it will
// log the last line
} else {
// Because this is in the "else" section, the following line will log if none
// of the prior conditions are met:
  console.log("Sorry, not enough charge to call an Uber.");
}

// YOU DO - ANNOTATE: Above each line of your code for this if statement, create a comment.
// That comment should describe, in your own words, and as technically precise as possible,
// what the line of code below, does. Done!

// MAKE 100% SURE that you have RUN the code in node in your command line, to ensure it works
// as you think it doesüåü Done!üëç
