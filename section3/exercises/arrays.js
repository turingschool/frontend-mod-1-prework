//-------------------
// PART 1: Animals: Array Syntax
//-------------------

// EXAMPLE: write code below that will log an array of animals.
// Store the array in a variable.
var animals = ["Zebra", "Giraffe", "Elephant"];
console.log(animals);

// EXAMPLE: Write code below that will log "Zebra" from the animals array
// YOUR CODE HERE
console.log(animals[0]);

// YOU DO: Write code below that will log the number of elements in array of
// animals from above.
console.log(animals.length);

// YOU DO: Write code that will reassign the last item in the animals
// array to "Gorilla"
animals[2] = "Gorilla";
console.log(animals);

// YOU DO: Write code that will add a new animal (type of your choice) to position 3.
animals[3] = "Tiger";
console.log(animals);

// YOU DO: Write code that will log the String "Elephant" in the animals array
animals.push("Elephant");
console.log(animals[animals.length - 1]);

//-------------------
// PART 2: Foods: Array Methods
//-------------------

// YOU DO: Declare a variable that will store an an array of at least 4 foods (strings)
var goodFood = ["yogurt", "oatmeal", "collard greens", "gnocchi"];

// YOU DO: Write code below that will log the number of elements in the array of
// foods from above.
console.log(goodFood.length);

// YOU DO: Write code below that uses a method to add "broccoli" to the foods array and
// log the changed array to verify "broccoli" has been added
goodFood.unshift("broccoli");
console.log(goodFood);

// YOU DO: Write code below that removes the last item of food from the foods array and
// log the changed array to verify that item has been removed
goodFood.pop();
console.log(goodFood);

// YOU DO: Write code to add 3 new foods to the array.
  // There are several ways to do this - choose whichever you'd like!
// Then, log the changed array to verify the new items have been added
goodFood.push("smoothie", "almonds", "popcorn");
console.log(goodFood);

// YOU DO: Remove the food that is in index position 0.
goodFood.shift();
console.log(goodFood);

//-------------------
// PART 3: Where are Arrays used?
//-------------------

/*
Sometimes we need to hold on to multiple pieces of data, but have it grouped together in a list.
This is why programming languages have arrays!

One example of a web/mobile application that uses arrays is Instagram. Each user has a set of posts
associated with their account. Each post, is one of potentially many, that are grouped together in a list,
or, array.

The post itself likely has more complex data, but here's one way we can think about it:
*/

var posts = ["image at beach", "holiday party", "adorable puppy", "video of cute baby"];

// YOU DO: Think of a web application you commonly use. Where do you see LISTS utilized, where arrays
// may be storing data? Come up with 3 examples - they could be from different web applications or
// all from the same one.

/* 1: The 'start your cart' section on the King Soopers website - it's a list of items I have
bought there before and can select from to buy again.
// 2: Any of the suggested shopping lists on the Amazon page. There are a bunch of different
ones - 'current customer favorites' or 'deals of the day.'
// 3: The repositories section on my GitHub homepage, listing all of my recently used repositories. */

// Part 4: Don't let yourself forget everything from Section 2 of Pre-work
//-------------------

/*
YOU DO:
Using the variables defined below, write a program that will tell a user if they
will be able to call an Uber.

The user can call an uber if they have 15% battery remaining, or more. In this case, it doesn't matter
if the user has a charger at all, or what type.
They can call an uber if they have a charger and it is a car charger.

*/
var percentBatteryLeft = 12;
var hasCharger = false;
var chargerType = "car";

// Write your conditional here
// Checks to see if the value for the percentBatteryLeft variable is greater than or equal to 15
if (percentBatteryLeft >= 15) {
//if the line above is true then the program will log "You can call an uber" and stop.
  console.log("You can call an Uber!");
//if the first line is false, the program keeps reading.
//Checks to see the values for hasCharger and chargerType. If hasCharger is true the program will continue to
// read the chargerType variable.
} else if (hasCharger && chargerType == "car") {
//if the line above is true then the program will log "You can call an Uber" and stop.
  console.log("You can call an Uber!");
//if the previous lines of code have not had conditions that have been met then this line will run.
} else {
//if the line above runs then the program will log "Better start walking." and stop.
  console.log("Better start walking.");
}



// YOU DO - ANNOTATE: Above each line of your code for this if statement, create a comment.
// That comment should describe, in your own words, and as technically precise as possible,
// what the line of code below, does.

// MAKE 100% SURE that you have RUN the code in node in your command line, to ensure it works
// as you think it doesðŸŒŸ
