//-------------------
// PART 1: Animals: Array Syntax
//-------------------

// EXAMPLE: write code below that will log an array of animals.
// Store the array in a variable.
var animals = ["Zebra", "Giraffe", "Elephant"];
console.log(animals);

// EXAMPLE: Write code below that will log "Zebra" from the animals array
// YOUR CODE HERE
console.log(animals[0]);

// YOU DO: Write code below that will log the number of elements in array of
// animals from above.

console.log(animals.length);

// YOU DO: Write code that will reassign the last item in the animals
// array to "Gorilla"

animals[2] = "Gorilla";
console.log(animals);

// YOU DO: Write code that will add a new animal (type of your choice) to position 3.

animals.push("Hippo");

// YOU DO: Write code that will log the String "Elephant" in the animals array

animals.unshift("Elephant");
console.log(animals[0]);

//-------------------
// PART 2: Foods: Array Methods
//-------------------

// YOU DO: Declare a variable that will store an an array of at least 4 foods (strings)

var favFoods = ["Pizza", "Fried Rice", "Tacos", "Pasta"];

// YOU DO: Write code below that will log the number of elements in the array of
// foods from above.

console.log(favFoods.length);

// YOU DO: Write code below that uses a method to add "broccoli" to the foods array and
// log the changed array to verify "broccoli" has been added

favFoods.unshift("Broccoli");
console.log(favFoods);

// YOU DO: Write code below that removes the last item of food from the foods array and
// log the changed array to verify that item has been removed

favFoods.pop();
console.log(favFoods);

// YOU DO: Write code to add 3 new foods to the array.
  // There are several ways to do this - choose whichever you'd like!
// Then, log the changed array to verify the new items have been added

favFoods.push("Celery", "Quinoa", "Sweet Potato");
console.log(favFoods);

// YOU DO: Remove the food that is in index position 0.

favFoods.shift();
console.log(favFoods);

//-------------------
// PART 3: Where are Arrays used?
//-------------------

/*
Sometimes we need to hold on to multiple pieces of data, but have it grouped together in a list.
This is why programming languages have arrays!

One example of a web/mobile application that uses arrays is Instagram. Each user has a set of posts
associated with their account. Each post, is one of potentially many, that are grouped together in a list,
or, array.

The post itself likely has more complex data, but here's one way we can think about it:
*/

var posts = ["image at beach", "holiday party", "adorable puppy", "video of cute baby"];

// YOU DO: Think of a web application you commonly use. Where do you see LISTS utilized, where arrays
// may be storing data? Come up with 3 examples - they could be from different web applications or
// all from the same one.

// 1:Previous orders on Amazon
// 2:Profile information on a dating profile- questions/prompts where you input info about your likes and dislikes.
// 3:Youtube- a list of the accounts I've subscribed to.

// Part 4: Don't let yourself forget everything from Section 2 of Pre-work
//-------------------

/*
YOU DO:
Using the variables defined below, write a program that will tell a user if they
will be able to call an Uber.

The user can call an uber if they have 15% battery remaining, or more. In this case, it doesn't matter
if the user has a charger at all, or what type.
They can call an uber if they have a charger and it is a car charger.

*/
var percentBatteryLeft = 12;
var hasCharger = false;
var chargerType = "car";

// Write your conditional here

//My Comment: Here I am establishing my first conditional statement. If a value of 15 or more is passed into this
//conditional statement (from the variable percentBatteryLeft) then the very next line is executed in the code block, directly
//below and within the curly braces: "You can use your phone to call an Uber." If percentBatteryLeft is less than 15 then the script will move to the next
//line.

if (percentBatteryLeft >= 15) {
  console.log("You can use your phone to call an Uber.");
}
//My Comment: If the script has moved onto this part of the code, then the if statement (above) returned false. Here
//the script will evaluate both of the statements, on either side of the AND operator. If either statement returns false
//the script will move on to the next part of the conditional statement and will not run the command in the code block,
//directly below else if. If both statements, on either side of the AND operator, return true then the line "You can
//charge your phone and use it to call an Uber." will be logged and the script will not move onto any other statements.
//Here I had to change my code, so that I'm using the strict equality operator. I attempted to run my code in the terminal,
//using simply the assignment operator in the parentheses here), and received an error warning. I understand that JavaScript
//would be assuming that I am attempting to reassign the values of hasCharger and chargerType instead of asking JavaScript
//to compare the values.
else if (hasCharger === true && chargerType === "car") {
  console.log("You can charge your phone and use it to call an Uber");
}
//My Comment: If the script has moved onto this part of the code, then the if and the else if statements (above) have
//returned false. Here, the script will default to running this code block, directly below else, and the line "You
//cannot use your phone to call an Uber. Start Walking!" will be logged.
else {
  console.log("You cannot use your phone to call an Uber. Start Walking!");
};

// YOU DO - ANNOTATE: Above each line of your code for this if statement, create a comment.
// That comment should describe, in your own words, and as technically precise as possible,
// what the line of code below, does.

// MAKE 100% SURE that you have RUN the code in node in your command line, to ensure it works
// as you think it doesðŸŒŸ
