_describe, in your own words, what each method does._

1. *pop* - The pop method removes the last element from an array. This element will be printed out and then no longer stores in the array.
  - Syntax: arr.pop()

2. *push* - The push method adds one or more new elements to the end of an array. It will then print the new length of the array, including the newly added elements.
  - Syntax: arr.push([element1[, ...[, elementN]]])

3. *shift* - The shift method takes out the first element of an array. This element will be printed out and then no longer stores in the array.
  - Syntax: arr.shift()

4. *unshift* - The unshift method adds one or more new elements to the beginning of an array. It will then print the new length of the array, including the newly added elements.
  - arr.unshift(element1[, ...[, elementN]])
