## Section 3 Reflection

#What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

_Staying in the Zone of Proximal Development is not a new concept to me, yet I still find it challenging to stay in that sweet spot without overreaching or playing it too safe._

_Focusing on the process also resonates with me as I almost always find that more translatable to results than focusing on goals._

#In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

_I think I tend to fall out of growth mindset when I lack a practical application or purpose for whatever I'm involved in learning. Possibility seems more abstract and out-of-reach when I don't have a project. Conversely, when I'm in the moment working spontaneously and creatively on something concrete I experience much more sense of purpose._

#Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

_I'd imagine that social media apps would use arrays to store friends/followers, as collections of individual accounts. It would seem conducive to adding or removing users from the group or including the group as a whole in actions such as sharing or privacy restrictions. It would also be useful for creating subgroups of accounts, in cases of community groups or lists._

#In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

_An array method is an action, with its own JS keyword, that can be called to manipulate an array in a predefined way._

#What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

_Looping is useful for when you want to perform an action a specific number of times/under a specific condition. It's helpful in an array context for running the same code for each element in an array, or a subset of elements._

_I'd imagine you could use loops for any variable containing integers, but I'm having a hard time thinking of a context in which you'd want to do that without an array._

#If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

_If you're running a race, you want to start at the starting line and stop at the finish line, because otherwise all your work doesn't count. You also want to run in a pretty straight line, because weaving or doing circles takes more effort to do the same thing, and that's annoying. Loops help you run the race from start to finish without wasting extra effort._

#What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?

_Virtually all the discussion of loops in this section was in the context of arrays, so if they have an eminent usage outside of that context it would be helpful to know, even if just as an aside for now._
