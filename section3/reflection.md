## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

I've been in both mindsets before, and being able to name my current mindset as 'growth' or 'fixed' helps me identify them more readily in the moment. I appreciated the distinction between focussing on the process of learning as opposed to the results, such as an 'A+' on an exam, and how process-orientation lends itself to developing more resilience in the face of mistakes and temporary failures.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

I currently demonstrate a growth mindset by not giving up if using one resource doesn't help a concept click; I just search for other resources and approaches that will help me grasp it.

I tend to have high expectations of myself; when these expectations aren't met, I have to work on responding not with disappointment and frustration, but rather, by reframing the situation as a learning opportunity on an endless path of incremental improvement.

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

Amazon.com probably uses arrays in its search filters, such as the condition of items being new, like new, or used.

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

Array methods are built-in functions that can help us transform elements in an array.

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

A loop allows us to do the same action over and over again. We would use a loop in conjunction with an array when we want to transform all the elements of an array in the same way. We can also use a loop without an array in many ways, such as listing a series of numbers or repeating a message in the console.

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

A loop is like a school bus driver on his bus route: He or she drives to a student's house, stops the bus, opens the door, greets the student, and closes the door. Then the driver repeats this until she or he's picked every student up on the route, at which point the driver drops the students off at school and finishes the loop. The driver is the interpreter, the actions involved in picking each student up are the transformations, and the students might be the elements in an array.

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?

How do you using nesting with arrays and loops?
