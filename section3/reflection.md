bothersome## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
- I need to set S.M.A.R.T goals instead of setting goals that only have an outcome with no parameters and time boundaries. Not giving up on a problem that might take hours to fix with a simple solution is key. Those hours are not wasted in vein, those hours were practice and learning what works and what doesn't. Being humble enough to ask for help is a strength not a weakness. Mistakes are learning opportunities and constructive feedback shouldn't be met with disappointment. It should be seen as chance to improve. I'd compare it to being like an error message that's a hint in disguise. There is no need to panic when faced with a challenge. In programming you will be in a constant state of learning and growing because there is always more to know in a changing industry. Panicking is a sign of having a fixed mindset rather than a growth mindset. Someone with a fixed mindset will see challenges in a negative light and suffer from imposter syndrome. The growth mindset is the cure for this.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
- Before covid made Turing a remote opportunity for me, I've been trying to teach myself how to code for years. Luckily I had the help and mentorship of my best friend Valentino Espinoza who is an alumni of Turing. There was a few times where I was faced with a challenge that made me feel totally incompetent and I had multiple episodes of imposter syndrome that led me to giving up. Fortunately there was something in me that desired to code, and I always came back to it. As I've gotten older, matured, learned more about the industry and practiced coding I've become more familiar with navigating through confusion. I started using the growth mindset without even knowing what it was. I convinced myself that the confusion and challenge I was facing was just a part of programming and there was no avoiding it. Basically, I stopped giving up when things got tough. I was set on becoming a self taught developer. Then one day my friend Ashish who previously asked me for help on becoming a self taught dev told me he applied and was accepted to Turing and that it was remote. At that moment I realized that in less than a year Ashish who asked me for help, would be landing a job in the industry and I'd still be struggling. So I took the leap, and applied to Turing and mapped out my life for the next year on short notice.

- I still struggle with asking for help. Even with a "Full Stack Senior Engineer" as a best friend I hesitate. I don't want to be bothersome, and I'm used to figuring things out myself even if I wasted a lot of time doing it. A big part of why I'm excited about Turing is because I'm going to learn more than just how to get code to work, I'm going to learn best practice, soft skills and how to work with others.  

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.
- Every playlist on a website like Spotify is probably an array. When you make your own playlist I'd imagine the application is creating an array specific to you and contains whatever you put on it. I think this sort of thing is done because it's easier on the code to interact with one array and its contents such as a playlist for working out instead of interacting with multiple parts and all the code required to find those separate parts.

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
- Array methods are tools that allow you to manipulate the contents of an array. The examples I studied so far for example, add or delete parts of an array.

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When should we use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
- A loop is a way to repeat a function as many times as needed without having to rewrite to function. For a loop with an array I'll use my Spotify playlist example from before. Lets say you want to play a play-list(array) of songs repeatedly(loop). Like clicking play on a playlist and it plays the next song for you without you having to. A loop without an array would be more like playing a single song repeatedly.

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
- A loop is a way to repeat a task without having to do it yourself every time.

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
- I'm just curious about other methods and uses for them both. This is something I need to study and practice more.
