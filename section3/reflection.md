## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
  * One thing that I found resonated with me is that the growth mindset is something that is more than just for learning in an educational enviroment. 
  * It can also be used in stuff for every day life. 

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

  * I use the growth mindset when I am learning new things, I was taught it very young in school. When I first started programing I used it especially when I was learning the fundamentals. One thing I never really thought about was using it outside of learning. I have been working on building more muscle and it has been a hard journey. I eventually started to tell myself that my body is as good as it is going to be. I have since realized that if I have a Growth Mindset toward building more muscle it would make doing this that are outside of my comfort zone a lot easier. 

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

  * On Facebook to show who is online they probably use an array of some kind.

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

  * An array method is a function that you can use on an array. They have a lot of uses like for example the .push method adds a new array element to the end of an array.

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

  * An example of using a loop array would be if you had a program that showed what cars where in stock and out of stock. You might have an array for both. You might want to loop through the in stock array and show all of the in stock cars.

  * Without an array you might want to count up from a specific number. 

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

  * A loop works like this. Say I gave you a toy, each day you keep that toy without losing it I will give you 1 dollar. If you lose the toy I wont give 
you any more money.

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?

  * I do not feel like I have any questions about Arrays and loops.
