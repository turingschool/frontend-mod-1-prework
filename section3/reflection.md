## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
- Understanding that I need to build a skill and that it's not just inherent will contribute to my motivation long term.
- Knowing that where I grew up, and what my past is, does not determine my capabilities will help me keep from doubting myself.

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
- I'd say that I do **and** don't believe that my skill will get better. In my mind I know that if I continue to work at something, that eventually I'll get better at it. However, knowing that doesn't keep myself from doubting it when I'm struggling. I try to remind myself that I have to fail to get better, but just remembering that it's true doesn't always convince me that it's happening.  

3. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.
- Developers likely use arrays to store information like items you've viewed or purchased on an online store.

4. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
- Array methods allow you to manipulate the elements in an array.

5. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
- A loop is used for automating iterations. You would use a loop with an array when you want to implement the elements in a section of code automatically. You'd use a loop without an array to make things like counters.

6. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
- Loops are like icemakers. You can manually fill multiple trays until you have a bucket of ice, or you can have an icemaker create ice until the lever is raised by the full bucket.

7. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
- I want to know common applications of loops using arrays are on the web.
