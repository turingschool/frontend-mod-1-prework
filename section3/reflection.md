## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

Two things that really resonated with me from the blog post were:
- mistakes are unavoidable and are actually part of the learning process: test a line of code, iterate, test again, and repeat until it properly executes.
- those with a growth mindset are not afraid to ask questions or seek information or constructive feedback from others.
- Focusing on what worked and what didn’t, and reevaluating your approach using strategies you’ve found to be effective is how you grow your coding skills.

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

Signing up for this course with Turing is demonstrating a Growth Mindset. I had the option of either staying in a career that I wasn't crazy about or learning something totally foreign and weird to me, and apparently I chose the weird thing. I also frequently choose to learn new things and explore new places in regards to exercise and hiking adventures.

I tend to be quite stubborn and once I've learned a good way to do something I am quite resistant to learning a different way that might be better.


3. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

The grocery store website has a Start Your Cart section that is most likely an array of items that I have previously bought and can choose to pick again to start my shopping cart.

4. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

Array methods are actions that we can perform on our lists of things inside of the array. There are a variety of different methods, but some examples would include adding or removing items from the beginning or the end of the list of items.

5. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

The purpose of a loop is to be able to perform the same action over and over again without having to write it out every time. We would lose the loop in conjunction with an array if we wanted to carry out the same action on each item inside of the array.

6. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

I would ask them to think about Bart Simpson writing on the chalkboard, the same phrase over and over, and I would say that if he knew how to code he could just get the computer to write that out for him. First we would need to set up or start the loop. This piece of code will initialize our loop var i = 1;. Then we need to make sure we put some code in so that the loop will eventually cycle through and get to an end, otherwise it will just run forever. We do this with our condition. If we need to write out "My Butt Does Not Deserve a Website" (from S9E19 fyi) one hundred times then the code we would write here would be 1 <=100 so that our statement would print out to the console 100 times and then stop. Our next piece of code is going to add a 1 to our variable number so that it can count up and get to 100. This piece of code will look like this - i++. If we wanted our code to count down from 100 then it would be i--. Now our loop is finished and we just need to tell the program what we want it to say. Our finished loop would look like this


```
for (var i = 1; i <=100; i++) {
    console.log("My Butt Does Not Deserve
    a Website.");
}
```
7. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?

Can I stop a loop mid-loop? If I mess up and make a continuous loop how does it stop?
