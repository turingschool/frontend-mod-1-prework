## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

*****
After reading https://blog.mindsetworks.com/entry/how-having-a-growth-mindset-can-help-you-learn-to-code  
I recognize my Growth Mindset clearly. I do like face a challenges and work on them, understanding my mistake is my part of the learning process is actually is bigger part of my growth, because as a new learner i am tent to make a mistakes and instead of getting frustrated on myself i do keep looking at the line of the code and try to figure where i did miss or mistake.
Being not afraid of asking for help have been my biggest win in my current learning process, it gives me advantage in a my learning path by comparing my work with other students and also see where i did made a mistake and take a note on that.
But i do know i still have to grow on SMART goals and push myself more out of my ability and limit, to become more experienced and proficient.

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.




1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
***
Array a type of variable which stores multiple elements and you can hold different key values in it, it can be string, integer etc.. and, it is separated by comma. It is helpful when you need to work with list of items which is at the end connected. Sometimes when you need to change a value of certain things, you better use an array to come back to it and reassign or add new value.
Array methods has some elements which works on changing elements in array.
pop()
push()
shift()
unshift()
slice()

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
 ***
 Loop is very handy when you need run code multiple times with different value. It is gives you access to do so.As far as condition returns "true" it will keep running until condition returns "false". Loop has 3 statements.
 // Initializer or starting point.
 // Condition, when you loop ends.
 // Increment, continious up or down.

 We also use for loop when we need run block specific number of times.
 For loops very handy when we need run code with each array item stored in it.
 We use for loops to iterate each item in array and set a same value or different
 value for each item in array.  
 We use loops with arrays when we need access to work with one of the array list items and run it again with setting new value.
 We use loop not only with arrays, but without , when we have one set of variable with value, to run it multiple times we just use a loop as well.

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
***
Train station with one train round trip destination to NY Manhattan and Patterson.
on each station people leave the train and get more people in. So its a circle of people getting in and out.So you do a loop with a different people in each station.

Loop in JAVASCRIPT same as a train station.Your variable is a "train" and value is "people" and end "stations".On each loop run you get a condition which is number of people getting in and out.

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
no
