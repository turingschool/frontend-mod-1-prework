## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
* Making a mental list of the concepts or ideas that I am struggling with. I loved how Carmen has made it a habit really pinpoint those issues, break them down logically, and then figure out how to tackle them. I'd really like to start doing that.
* I mentioned this in my intro video, but I tend to compare myself to others and then get discouraged when I'm not learning at their pace. Hearing the reminder that we all have different learning styles and some of us are slower was refreshing and I have to be even more aware of that.


1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
* I learned about a year ago how to set smaller goals in order to accomplish something big. I would always put big tasks on my list of things todo but would never get them done because they were so big and intimidating. I would feel like garbage at the end of the day when I couldn't cross anything off my list. Then I started writing down the first step in order to get that big task done - the next day I would write down the next step, and so on until I had finally completed it! I've even done this for super stupid tiny tasks like "pick out thread colors for next embroidery project". It doesn't mean  I have to sew yet, it's just the first step and it gets me a little bit closer to finishing that goal.
* I will admit I am still learning how to take correction and feedback. My dad always told us kids growing up that "feedback is a gift." I used to be really annoyed by that because for the longest time I would take the feedback/correction personally and then I resented the person telling me what to fix. I had to learn to remind myself that this person is actually helping me and wants me to succeed...and that feedback IS in fact a gift! They aren't trying to tear me down, but are helping me grow. So that is something I'm still working on and I'll probably master by the time this course is done.

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

 * **duolingo :** `var languagesLearning = ["Spanish", "Polish", "French"];` developers might use an array in the duolingo app when keeping track of the names of the languages you are trying to learn.

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
* Array methods are specific actions designed to modify an array.

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
* a loop helps you do a repetitive task quickly and easily. If you wanted to quickly capitalize the first letter of every name in an array you could create a loop, iterate that loop over your array, and if done correctly it will print out all the values in the array but now with a capital letter. You could also use a loop if you needed to print out "have a nice day" 600 times. Instead of copy and pasting "have a nice day" 600 times you can just make a loop that will do it for you, but then stops at 600 so that you don't have an infinite loop going. 

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
* A loop is like if you had the chore of watering all the plants in the house. The action of you watering the plants is the loop. All the plants in the house are the items you will be "looping through". First you water one plant, when you finished watering that you have completed one loop and then you move on to the next plant. You continue "looping through" or watering the plants (doing the same action) until you have watered every single one in the house.

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
