## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
* **Point 1:** "By seeking out challenges" can one utilize a growth mindset to develop their coding. As part 1 of the Growth Mindset article points out, an application or program has no reason to exist without a challenge. Solving a problem is how a developer makes use of and further develops their knowledge and skills - they should welcome a chance to test what they know.

* **Point 2:** "By being open to feedback and suggestions" can one use what they learn as a programmer to develop a growth mindset. An application is not built by an individual, it's built by a team of individuals. Each member will have different experience and knowledge, so it's important to seek feedback from those who can view your code from different perspective. This will only lead to better code individually and overall.

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
* **Things I Currently Do:** I love a challenge and actively seek them out, so that I may test what I know and put my knowledge into practice. The exercises present within these pre-work sections are great and I'm happy to work through them (and really push myself where applicable). Something I might consider, time-willing, is finding coding challenges to work through on my own.
* **Things I Need to Work On:** As I've mentioned in previous reflection assignments, I tend to forgo asking questions and plow through issues on my own. Maybe I feel vulnerable, or it could be my social anxiety, but I'm certainly aware of my limitations in this regard. I haven't really gotten to a point where I needed to ask a question, via Slack, but I'm going to stick to the "20 minute" rule when this ceases to be the case (and I know it will).

3. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.
* Amazon has a "Based on your..." section on their home page that lists a collection of products related to past purchases. These items are more than likely stored in an Array and then printed on the webpage. As to the contents of the array, I'm almost positive the values are a bit more complex than simple Strings.

4. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
* An "array method" is a method (or action) that can be performed on an array. These will typically access or manipulate data stored within attributes or properties. A few examples of array methods include: shift(), pop(), unshift(), and push().

5. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
* A loop is used to repeat (or iterate) a block of code depending on a given condition. The loops available in JavaScript are: for, while, and do while.
* A "for" loop can be used to iterate over an array if multiple (or all) elements within an array need to be modified or accessed. For example, if each element needed to be printed on the console, a "for" loop could be used to access each element and print them individually upon each iteration.

6. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
* The following presumes that this 5 year is frequently given some sort of device to watch child-oriented YouTube videos. I'd tell them that an "iteration" is essentially a single video that plays. Unless they close out of YouTube, manually click on another video, or turn off the device, once the video is finished, YouTube will "loop" and automatically select another video or "iteration".

7. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
* What would be the purpose of assigning an Array using the "array constructor"? And is an "Array" a class? It defines a set of methods and properties (or attributes) for each assigned array, so my assumption is yes.
