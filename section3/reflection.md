## Section 3 Reflection

**1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?**   
Smart planning and experince and practice both resonated with me.   
**2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?**  
I think seeking out challenges and not being afraid to seek help are two growth mindsets that I need to start using more often. I rarely ever seek help or want to. Seeking out challenges is always fun, but for learning and growing I think I definitely need to start doing it more often. Two that I already demonstrate is setting SMART goals and understanding that experience and practice is essential for growth. I am a hands on learner and experience and practice is vital to me learning and growing. Also, if I set goals for myself it helps me look forward to learning.

**3. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.**   
One application / website that I use regularly is Steam. Steam has an array of video game types for sale. Ex: Survival, Adventure, Action, RPG, Racing  

**4. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.**  
An Array method is a method that changes an array. This could remove an element from an array, add an element to an array, count the length of an array, etc.

**5. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?**  
The purpose of a loop is to iterate a part of your program multiple times. You would use a loop when you want to change multiple elements and log it. If you only need the array to repeat once then there is no need for a loop.  

**6. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?**   
A loop is how we make the program repeat something multiple times. This is easier than typing it out each time, instead the program does it for us.   

**7. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?**   
Can we make a loop for multiple arrays?
