## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
-  Zone of Proximal Development is new to me. It's good to know not to stretch yourself too much at one time.
- I agree that understanding mistakes is essential to learning.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
- I think I do well on reflecting on the process of coding
- Need to improvement on seeking challenges.

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.
- Twitter. My timeline is a list of all tweets posted recently.

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
- An array method is a specific action of modifying contents of the array.

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
- A loop saves codes and space for repeating tasks by writing code once and executes many times.
- When we need to perform an action involving iterating elements in an array, we use loop.

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
- Suppose you are allowed to take up to 5 candies per day.
- Here is a button. Every time you press it, you get a candy.
- The button will remember how many candies you already have and will only give you five per day.
- That button is called loop.

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
- What does the author mean in the book *Javascript and Jquery* on page 174 that "Any variable you can define outside of the loop and that does not change within the loop should be defined outside of it. If it were declared inside the loop, it would be recalculated every time the loop ran, needlessly using resources"?
