## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

  - SMART and ZPD were new to me, but the the things that resonated were "understanding mistakes" and "not being afraid to seek help". "Focusing on the process" is very important to grow any skillset.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

  - I currently demonstrate focusing on the process and understanding mistakes. However, setting SMART goals are sort of foreign to me.

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

  - Twitch might use arrays in displaying directories for streamers, games, and past broadcasts. All of which are sorted either by viewers or dates.

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

  - An array method is something that iterates over or manipulates an array.

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

  - Loops are used to iterate over an array and produce a result for each item in that array. Generally, loops are used to repeat an action X times.

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
  - Loops are like a factory built to do a set order of things to what is put in them. Sometimes, something can be put into this factory that it is not built for and thus the factory is shutdown. On the other hand, if the factory is ready it will proceed to do the same actions.
1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?

 - What would be a good way to avoid infinite loops?
