## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

_I liked the idea of setting S.M.A.R.T. (specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound) goals as I am familiar to the concepts of creating OKRs and KPIs. The next sticking point for me was the bit about tracking only your own progress and not comparing yourself to anyone._

_"Struggling means that you're learning"._

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

_I regularly try to practice humility when it comes to things I do not know; being able to admit it and not afraid to ask questions is important. I am not entirely goal oriented (even though I understand the value in it) and have a hard time setting S.M.A.R.T. goals, but I am focused on changing this behavior._

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

_In Spotify, when you build a playlist; the list of songs may be stored in an array._

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

_Functions specific for arrays that help move through, select, or mutate arrays and their elements._

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

_Loops are useful for repeating or iterating over conditions and code blocks. They are useful for arrays if we want to same code for each item in the array, but can also be useful for other use against other data types which have a singular value if we need to repeat something or mutate that value in some way._

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

_Loops allow us to tell the computer to repeat an action a number of times, and allows us to tell it when to stop doing that thing._

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?

_What is a real life scenario where we would want to use a for loop in reverse order (decrement index)?_
