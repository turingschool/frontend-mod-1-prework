## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

I loved the idea of improving within a ZPD aka "Zone of Proximal Development". Instead of trying to tackle something that's waaay beyond the scope of my coding skills, I can focus on overcoming tiny challenges that stretch just beyond what I'm capable of. This way I'll be cultivating my skills with each little victory, eventually expanding my ZPD to that "unreachable" spot.

Another aspect of having a growth mindset that resonated with me was framing asking for help as a strength rather than as a weakness. I've seen this concept used in other contexts, but never in relation to a growth mindset. Throughout Mod 0, I found that my ego prevented me from asking for help in a few situations. I think it could be powerful for me to start thinking about asking for help as a supplement to my own growth rather than something to be ashamed of.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

I think I'm starting to get the hang of not being afraid of mistakes. When I started out learning code I was so scared to mess anything up, but now I realize that if I just go for it rather than constantly referring to an example, I can internalize the process more easily. If that means I get error messages along the way, so be it. I am also finding that while I'm researching new topics in the pre-work, I often end up going deeper and trying to challenge myself beyond what the exercise is asking. I'm seeking challenges. One thing I definitely don't do yet is make SMART goals. I've never been a "goal" type person, but lately I have been trying to set more tangible goals for myself. I think the value of intentionally making a goal specific, attainable, measurable, realistic, and time-based could be really beneficial in my growth process at Turing.

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

I probably use TikTok more often than what's considered healthy, and I think that one place they would use arrays is whenever someone makes a video using a specific audio file (which is every video on the app). In regards to that specific audio file (which could be either a song or the user uploaded audio), an empty array would be created once the first video is uploaded using that sound. Every time another user uploads a video that uses that same audio, that video would then be added to the array. This enables users to easily view all the videos that have been made with a certain song, as well as letting the app developers track what songs are trending.

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

An Array method is an action that modifies an array or uses an array to calculate something. For example, the `.length` method sums up the number of elements within an array and calculates that into an integer. The `.pop` method modifies an array by removing the last element within it.

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

A loop is the repetition of a statement (or set of statements) for a specified number of iterations. The purpose of loops is to make coding less tedious, as well as being able to execute more complex programs. If the loop is infinite, it will break the code. One way to use a loop in conjunction with an array is by comparing the `i` variable in the conditional statement of a `for` loop to a method relating to an array. For example, `i < array.length` would tell the loop to run as many times as the number of elements in `array`. One way to use a loop without having it tied to an array is by simply comparing the `i` variable to an integer. Setting a condition like `i < 5` in a `for` loop would make whatever statements are in a loop run `5` times.

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

Instead of having to count how long you brush your teeth, imagine if your toothbrush just brushed your teeth for you and stopped brushing them when it knew that it had been long enough time.

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?

I'm curious to know more about whether you can put loops within loops, or possibly setting the conditional within a loop to an `if/else` statement. I also need to learn more about the other types of loops that aren't `for` loops.
