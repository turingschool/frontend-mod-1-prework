## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

  - I felt very connected to most of the concepts mentioned in blogs and video. In particular, _ZPD_ or _Zone of Prozximal Development_
    and _Seeking Challenges_ were of interest to me. I love the idea of being pushed just hard enough to make progress. Not too much that you are overwhelmed, but just enough to keep progressing. It makes so much sense. Tying that concept in with constant challenge seeking will perpetuate a continual growth cycle that you can benefit from indefinitely.   

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

  - Since I have had the opportunity to take risks with owning a business, and managing people, I have been exposed to making, and learning
    from, mistakes. Those experiences have taught me to be in a constant state of reflection about my thoughts and actions. I am never so overly confident in anything I do, and always allow room for the possibility that I misjudged a situation.

  - One area that I am excited to work on is practice. There many hobbies, sports, and interests that I have taken to a certain level,
    but then stopped. I no longer want to live that way. The challenge that Turing will provide will help me push myself just a little bit further every time I hit a hurdle.

3. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

  - I am certain that almost every application under the sun we use incorporates arrays. Anytime we are logging in personal information about ourselves in Facebook, Google accounts, or Shopping sites, we are sending information about past purchases, interests, or characteristics to be stored in a profile.

4. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

  -An array method is used to manipulate or give us information about the data collected in the array.

5. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

  - A loop is probably one of the most important features in programming. Being able to perform certain tasks under certain conditions repetitively would be unrealistic for a human to perform. A loop passing over an array has the ability to scan for and take particular bits of information in a large collection of data and sort the outcomes or actions for each item.

6. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

  - It would be like a machine that could go through your all of your toys on the floor, and put them away until there are no more toys left.

7. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?

  - I still need to learn the most effective ways to use them!
