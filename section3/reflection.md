## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

One point that stuck with me was setting "S.M.A.R.T." goals-- particularly the "measurable" and "achievable" parts, as I sometimes set really abstract or non-specific or even outright unrealistic goals, and then feel a lot of anxiety to meet them, and then feel bad about myself when I can't achieve them when really I could've set myself up better to begin with. The other was being okay with making mistakes, and that actually being a positive-- this also ties into my anxiety and disappointment in myself, because I put pressure on myself to be perfect and then feel bad when inevitably me or my work is not perfect, so trying to reframe mistakes as a positive in my own mind will be helpful.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

I think I'm starting to develop more and more of a growth mindset-- there are specific things that I already believe, like the fact that skill matters more than talent, and things that I've been working on incorperating already, like pushing myself in technical ways, goal-setting, and challenging myself to ask for help and make mistakes. But a lot of these I need to get better at, and more intentional at incorperating. In particular the last two, I need to set specific strategies and goals around-- like, trying to write down X number of questions per assignment, etc.

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

The website Jackbox.tv might use arrays for their Quiplash game submissions -- something like `var userAnswers = ["Joke One", "Joke Two"];`. This is because each user has multiple submissions per round that need to be kept track of and called on later.

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

An array method is a built-in function that you can use to alter or work with arrays. You can use array methods to get information about your array, to change the values within an array, to add to your array or remove items from your array, etc.

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

The purpose of a loop is to cycle through a block of code and repeat an action multiple times (theoretically infinitely), without having to write that code multiple times. You could use a loop in conjunction with an array when you're performing an action on every item of an array, like altering its value or printing it out. You can also use a loop without an array, like if you have some sort of action that you want to repeat multiple times (like autoplaying a video, or any sort of performing a function over and over).

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

A loop basically tells the computer to keep repeating the same thing over and over while a certain statement applies. For example, you can tell the computer to keep printing out a sentence until it's printed it out 10 times, or to keep playing a video over and over until the person using the computer clicks the "pause" button. The nice thing about loops is you only have to write the instructions once, and it can go on as many times as you need it to and stop when you want it to.

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?

I'm still a little shaky on `while` loops in particular-- I understand generally when to use `for` vs. when to use `while`, but the potential of accidentially getting my program stuck in an endless loop is scary. And I haven't used `do while` loops at all-- so my question is what is `do while` used for?
