## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
* I think the process of reflecting is really interesting! I've always been a very reflective individual but a lot of times I find myself using reflection as a means to be overly critical of myself and so there will need to be a balance struck here, for me!
* Being accepting of critical feedback is another huge standout to me. Often times, feedback can be met with a brick wall due to past experiences with ill intentioned or inexperienced feedback. I'm a bit anxious about receiving and giving feedback to peers who've I've never actually met in real life but I'm committed to showing up with a growth mindset and 'we win as a team' attitude!

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
* Currently, I demonstrate a growth mindset by knowing and accepting that mistakes are critical to learning, particularly in coding!
* On the flip side, I have a hard time asking for help out of fear of sounding/looking dumb. At the start of this year, I resolved to stop making decisions out of fear and so this is a very big thing that I am working on and I know Turing will help immensely!

3. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.
* I use Apple Maps pretty much anytime I go anywhere. Maps have loads and loads of data so there's likely a ton of array usage! There's likely arrays that hold calculations for distances from my active location to the locations of various places around me. So, if I'm looking for a coffee shop near me, it'll likely pull from an array of zip codes where I'm located and then pull the distances of all the coffee shops near me and feed me a list of closest to farthest.

4. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
* Array methods are functions that can be applied to arrays, granting us the ability to iterate on arrays, resulting in a lot less code writing. Ultimately, array methods make a lot of things possible that wouldn't be humanly possible without them!

5. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
* Loops basically tell the computer to run a block of code repeatedly until a certain condition is met. Anytime you want to apply the same function to multiple elements of an array, us a loop!

6. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
* loops basically allow you to make a computer do a lot of the heavy lifting for you. for example, if you were working on your math homework and had to write down your numbers 1 to 100, you could instruct a computer to do that quickly for you with just a couple lines of code! Think about how long it would take you to type 1 to 100 versus writing a few instructions and the computer does it for you in less than a second!

7. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
* Super curious about let versus var! I don't think that's exclusively important for arrays and loops but I saw it a lot in research so I'm just eager to know more about them!
