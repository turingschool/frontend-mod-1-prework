## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
* that struggling is normal in code but it shouldn't demotivate. Struggling means that you're learning. This really resonated with me as I'm new to the coding world and could feel discouraged various times throughout the day and can get in that negative mindset, but her words of "struggling means you're learning" has helped get me into that growth mindset when i've been struggling in code.
* By practicing setting S.M.A.R.T. goals Setting Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-Bound goals I will be more efficient in my learning approach by not wasting time and focusing on code with clarity and focus.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
* I think I have a growth mindset in when I'm struggling, because i do get discouraged but i've learned that walking away from the problem for a bit and coming back helps give you a new perspective and helps solve the problem.
* also that practice in code calls for improvement, also that mistakes are necessary. i've learned with errors you learn more.

*I need to get better at using the S.M.A.R.T goals. I have a hard time setting goals for coding. and jotting down my progress and process. never been good at being able to explain my thoughts in words.. 

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.
* If I were on adidas shopping i think developers would use and array on the type of products that are being offered. for example:
  Womens
  clothes ["tops", "bottoms","outerwear"];

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
* an array method is used to store multiple values in one variable. stores a type of list. the index of an array always starts at [0,1,2.] etc..

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When would we use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
* the purpose a loop is to help make the life of a developer easier when trying to run the same code multiple times with a different value each time the code is being run. we use the for loop for arrays. Instead of printing an element by element, you can iterate the index using for loop starting from 0 to length of the array (ArrayName. length) and access elements at each index.

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
* Loops are a a way to do things over and over an dover again with a different end result each time.

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
* I get confused in when to to the => ++ -- on the loops. and the syntax is a little confusing but its a lot easier to understand.
