## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

*I've read the article and watched the video, in the article I can resonate with effort and more practice, also really like the smart goals,I think I've mentioned it not by name, but in one of the Turing questionnaires. I love that part that says:Focus on the process, Iterating and refining the code, I think this will be essential to growth as a software engineer*

*About the video, the concepts of fixed mindset and Growth mindset are new to me, the understanding is not.I've been practicing the 3 questions: what am i struggling with ? why? How can I change it?, for a long time, it is my way of not getting too anxious.What i've learned specifically for programming is : if you are having one of those bad days, just take the day off, it is ok. You will lear/do a lot more if you are rested.There's no short cut to learning, everyone has its own time and it is ok.*

*I also loved that she shared about her first reaction to difficulties was panicking, I was panicking here yesterday and i really had to calm myself down to be able to continue learning, not only "doing". I stoped and remembered myself: - Have fun, this process is only one time, so enjoy and learn all you can, in the best way you can.*     

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

*I think i have the right mindset when i stop and remember to enjoy the process, to think in every article i'm reading with curiosity, when i see a new concept and see i'm not at it and think: let's go, this is just the beginning!*

*Where i don't yet is about asking dumb questions, i'm ashamed, and i forgot to say yesterday, but I absolutely loved the article about dumb questions, so much me in there, i had fun reading, and it helped me to see the questions in a different way ... even just asking questions, sometimes is so much job just to frame the question correctly that it looks much easier just try one more time, I have to do better about this one.*  

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

*Amazon app, You can buy a list of items, or collection of items. For that you will put them into the cart, starting a list of items.  I think they use arrays in the carts. I also think they use Array methods, because you can add items, remove items, save items to buy later, without having to open a new cart each time.*

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

*Array method is the method you use to perform a task in the Array. You can add items, remove Itens, change Itens, change the item, without rewriting the array*  

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

*The purpose of a loop is to repeat an action.We will use a loop in conjunction with array when we want to run the same code for each item in the array.It is useful when we are dealing with a small number of items.However, if we are dealing with a lot fo items it would make the page slower to load. You would not use it If the condition never returns false, this would get the computer into a infinite loop.*  

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

*I would ask the Kid: - Did you brush your teeth today?If the answer is yes, i would ask how many times ? then I would ask them if they will brush their teeth tomorrow, and how many times? And the last question would be : how many days of this week have you brushed your teeth? The answer probably would be every day, three times a day, so I would say: you are repeating over and over again, brushing your teeth until 3 times a day correctly? Then you start the next day from zero. and brush your teeth three times again. This is a loop. Something you do and repeat from the beginning over and over again.*   

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?

*I'm not sure about all the Array Methods,How many do we have?*
