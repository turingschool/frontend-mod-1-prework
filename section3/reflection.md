## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

* 1. Tracking progress was a new idea, but it makes a lot of sense. I think I already get that opportunity through Turing with the career journal, but I would like to figure out a committed structure to updating it.

* 2. Not comparing yourself to your peers resonates a lot. I'm very good at doing this once I have some confidence. I'm always certain that I'm not the best in the world, but that doesn't bother me as long as I'm better than I was. But when you're learning something new, it can be hard to keep your peers' progress out of your head, especially when you've seen their work far exceed yours. I need to remember that even now at the beginning, my journey is my journey.  

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

* I think I really believe that I can learn most things that I want to learn. I always thought I was doomed to a life of unskilled labor and struggle like the rest of my family when I was a kid, but I've been able to grow out of that by taking every opportunity to learn something that interests me. I think I started my learning journey with skateboarding when I was 9. A few years later I started learning to play the drums. and before I knew it I was getting onto local skatepark and skateshop teams and getting asked to play in bands. Then I denied an offer to be a linguist when I joined the military, but I was eventually ordered to become one after I was officially in and subject to orders. Only 2 of the 6 Marines that I started with finished the whole pipeline, and I was eventually awarded the 'linguist of the quarter'. I thought for sure I would never go to college because no one in my family ever has, but now I have a bachelor's degree, and I learned a third language while I did it. Now I'm starting my programming journey, and these growth mindset concepts all ring true with my past experiences. In the beginning of all of them I wasn't confident and always felt like I was behind, but after lots and lots of practice and work, I was able to at least become proficient.

* I've always been very unstructured in my practice. I practice when I want, and I only practice what I want to. For example, I've played drums for 15 years, and I've only been running drills and rudiments away from my kit for about 2 years now. I've finally hit a wall that I never would have if I had been doing those basic exercises from the beginning and dedicating time specifically to them. I think with programming, I can avoid this by paying attention and dedicating time to the small, easily-overlooked skills like typing and workflow. I've already started by running typing exercises before I do any coding as a like a warm-up. I've also been forcing myself to exclusively use command keys and shortcuts to navigate my computer whether I'm coding or just playing around on reddit.

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

* Reddit probably uses arrays to group the list of awards that you have from posts and comments. When you have a comment/post that someone thinks is extra special, they might gift you an award like a gold or silver piece. You're account now holds onto that award, and you can gift that award to a post/comment that you think is extra special. There is a page in your account where you can see all of the awards that you have. For an especially popular redditor it may look something like this:
'var awards = ['gold', 'silver', 'gold', 'gold', 'platinum']'

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

* An array method manipulates the elements of an array to be used outside of that array or change the array itself. They can add, remove, or isolate elements...so far.

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

* A loop exists to make possible running the same code as many times as you need to. It is made one million times better by being customizable to different parameters for each time that the code block runs. I love loops. I'm sure Bart Simpson would've loved to have a loop when he had to write all those sentences on the board for the Simpson's intros.

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

* First, I would make the lil fella a cup of hot cocoa in a Keurig machine. Then I would ask him what he thinks happens when I press the start button. When he gave me an answer, I would say this:
- "Every time we want some hot cocoa, all we gotta do is press that button right? And all of those things happen for us right? Well, what if we could press that start button, and the machine made 10 CUPS OF HOT CHOCOLATE?! That's what a loop is! When we need a lot things to happen a lot of times, we make a loop so that we just press one button and it does all of them all of the times we need it to." 

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?

* Again, I'm sure our lord and savior google can answer this, but is there an array method to hot swap elements? Could I just replace an element with one method rather than `.pop` then `.push`?
