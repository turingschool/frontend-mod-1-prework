## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

The idea of the myth of the brilliant developer.  This makes a lot of sense and the concept of an unreachable goal being a driving factor leading to the deterioration of workflow really resonates.  We are just where we are in our development in any skill and need to be accepting of that and really work on strengthening our mindset to growth in order to succeed in a craft.

New to me was the idea that there are two different mindsets, fixed and growth.  In a fixed mindset we limit opurselves to what our possibilities are, as we believe we are capable only of what we can do right now.  A growth mindset opposes that, as we are only at a place we have arrived to where we do not grasp what we are yet capable of.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

I demonstrate a growth mindset in my musical work, where I realize that there is a lifetime of concepts that are possible and have not been mastered.
I do not demonstrate this in my construction work, where I have reached a time period where anything I do requires no imagination and I am so versed in how to proceed with any task that it has become superbly mundane when at one point I had considered it exciting.

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

I Mobile app: Mini Moog Model D
The developers probably used arrays when listing patches.  I imagine that these arrays are indexed and information is taken when being effected upon. The user can choose which preset is used and the patch change may look something like this: currentPatch = patchList[i] when user enters i.

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

A method is an action that modifies or requests a return on index information in an array.

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

A loop is used so that a computer can do a large job that is very convenient for us: Doing something over and over again using a different value each time.
We would use a loop in conjunction with an array when we would like to perform some function for each one of a list of items.

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

We would wash the dishes one at a time and imagine doing it just once for every dish in China.

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?

I am interested in what prototype does and how we can extract information from fixed arrays while using variable array copies like branches.  I'm just imagining wanting to keep a master array.
