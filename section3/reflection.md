## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

   I would say that focusing in **reflecting** the process of coding it's new for me, and I've found myself going back to my code and making sure I understand the concepts, syntax and see if there is a way to improve the code with less steps. The other one that resonated with me it was to **seeking out challenges** to expand knowledge and expertise, facing the unknown and transforming it in *known*.

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

   I've practiced many of this principles before, maybe without being aware or having then under this structure of meaningful habits, for example, *understanding that mistakes are essential to learn* is part of daily life for me, I always try to be nice to myself when making mistakes so that way I can take the most out of it and learn. *Not being afraid to seek help* is also something I practice often at work and on my personal life, I find fascinating how much I can grow and enrich my life by adding the input and experience of others into my stream of knowledge. By *seeking out for challenges* it's the reason why I'm here right now writing this answer, I was not being challenge at work and in my personal life enough to feel that I was growing or becoming a better me, and it was when I started to research many different paths of development. When we talk about *focusing on the process of reflecting*, it's been there as an skill from life, after any given situation where i liked or not the outcome, there was always a process of observation to identify what went well and what didn't, that way I've been more prepared for further situations where I was required to solve or do something about.

   Now, the *SMART*, and the *improve one's zone of proximal development* are kind of new at least with this perspective, using it as an active strategy to succeed at Turing it's been an incredible process that I'm enjoying and embracing for the rest of my life.

3. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

   An example of this can be Amazon, I think in the section of my orders, all of this ones could be stored on an array.
   Then they can iterate through this array to determine the type of product, and for example if the product is type perishable, then amazon will offer to buy again.

4. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

   An array is a method where you can store a list of related elements into a variable.

5. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

   The purpose of a loop is to perform repetitives tasks a certain number of times. And we use a loop in conjunction with an array when we want to go through the elements of the array to perform an specific task.

6. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

   A loop is way to repeat things many times without getting tired. For example, when we have to eat, we need to do several things, like place the table, sit down, grab the fork, and so on. So by installing a loop in your brain now you can do all of those things several times a day without getting tired.

7. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?

   None at this time, but I'm sure once I keep practicing more, the questions will arise.
