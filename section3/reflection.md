## Section 3 Reflection

**1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?**

 - Two points that majorly stuck out from the ariticle was a statement that was made, basically saying "Those willing to practice will have a higher chance to have a greater growth mindset." In fighting games a person that grinds more and practices his flaws will have better gameplans/gameplay over someone that doesn't take the time to do such. The same will go for anything in life. If you try your hardest and grind through all of the hardship and problems, your outlook will be much better in the long run and your goals will look more obtainable. Onto the next big point, which is setting goals that are obtainable. In the video they stated that if you make your goal to large, you are doomed to fail or at least hurt your mentality. This resonates with me because I always set goals to high, and when I don't follow through with them I usually am put in a very destructive mindset.

**2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you not?**

 - I demonstrate a growth mindset with my willingness to try and find a positive out of most situations. I have always tryed my hardest in situations I most care about, which has caused me some strain in the past. However, due to those experiences I have grown more as a person and as a worker. Being willing to keep pushing through even when you hate what you do is a strength that causes better growth as a human-being.

**3. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.**

 - The web developers behind bracket generators 100% use arrays. The reason behind this is because of the consistant use of repeating variables. Imagine recreating a loop of a bracket seed for every individual tournament, instead of putting that seed into an `array` and looping it. They have to constantly reuse assets in groups which means they use arrays to keep those assests together.

**4. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.**

 - An `array` method is a unique function that we choose to change the way our `array` works. It also saves us time from writing in a more formated way.

**5. What is the purpose of a loop? When would we use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

 - A loops purpose is recreate script so that we don't! Instead of writing the number five 100 times manually, a loop can do it for us automatically in a split second! We would use loops in conjunction with arrays when we are targeting multiple assets at once. We would then use loops without them when we are targeting a singular asset.

**6. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?**

 - Just like how I explained it before. Imagine you having to write the word "the" a thousand times. Loops write "the" a thousand times for us!

**7. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?**

 - I mostly have smaller questions behind the function of them for web developers. When are loops most usefull? And when are they used more commonly in conjunction with arrays?
