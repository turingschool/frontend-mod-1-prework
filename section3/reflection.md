## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

    - The concept of striving to improve within one's Zone of Proximal Development was new to me. It is helpful to think of how to improve within reach and then move on to something more complex once we have understood concepts within our capability.
    - The concept of seeking out challenges really resonated with me and it is one of the main reasons why I decided to go into coding. I grow from challenges and tend to get bored of situations when I am not challenged. I feel like programming will always present new challenges no matter the level of experience.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

    - I demonstrate a Growth Mindset in the sense that I seek out challenges and enjoy the process of learning. I believe that with effort, you can accomplish almost anything and tend to follow through with my goals.
    - I think the ways in which I don't demonstrate it comes out in my struggle with asking questions or accepting my mistakes. I enjoy getting feedback and seek out feedback often, but tend to hesitate to ask questions because I have a hard time coming up with questions in the moment or thinking of a "good question". I used to think that you should be able to avoid mistakes if you do things "right", but now I know that mistakes are inevitable, and I am working on changing that mindset and ask questions without being afraid of asking a "dumb question."

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

    - In an email application, they use arrays for contacts, or email folders/categories.

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

    - Arrays have methods that can perform changes (e.g., add, remove, etc.) to those arrays.

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

    - To perform a a task (run a code block) multiples times.
    - We use loops in conjunction with an array when we need to iterate an task with/to each item of the array.  

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

    - We use loops when we need to repeat a task but we do not want to write the instructions over and over again. It is sort of like when you need to fold the laundry and you need fold each piece of clothing until you are done with all of them. You don't need your mom to tell you the instructions over and over again for each piece of laundry. She just asks you once and you know you need to go through all the pieces of clothing until you are done.

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?

    - I assume arrays can get pretty big with multiple items, is there an item limit in arrays?
    - How do we manage arrays when they get too big, for example, for an email application?
