## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

* In the video/podcast, Carmen mentioned the idea of the "stereotypical perfect engineer", and how this was a myth. This idea is something that really resonated with me, as I have considered learning how to program many times over the years but was always afraid to start because I felt that I didn't fit within that stereotype, and therefore would never be good at the job or accepted by my (theoretical) coworkers. I think that ideas like this are a big reason why developers are such a homogenous group (in addition to the increased opportunities that privilege allows).

* A reflection I had from these conversations is that a growth mindset is sort of self-fulfilling, in a way. When you open yourself up to the possibility of growth in any area, seeing it happen allows you to shift your mindset even more. After leaving college, I think I adopted a fixed mindset as I entered the workforce. For me, a lot of this had to do with the fact that I was in a customer facing role and I am not really a "people person", in the sense that I'm not good at sales and building customer relationships. I get along with people well, I am just shy in these types of situations. I felt really limited by my own personality and adopted more of a fixed growth mentality (e.g. "I'll never be as charming or outgoing as Patrick so I'm never going to excel in this role"), avoiding taking on responsibilities that involved a lot of interaction. However, I also started some new hobbies around this time, and seeing my own improvement at these hobbies that I was really bad at at first helped me to realize that I could become better in other areas too if I applied myself more.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

* I currently demonstrate a growth mindset in my willingness to learn new outdoor hobbies, and expectation that if I put in a lot of practice I can excel at them even though I am starting as an adult. For example, in the last five years I have learned to rock climb, ski, and surf, and while I have varying levels of skill in all of them, I can clearly see that the more time I invest the better I get. Although a lot of people I know have been doing these sports since they were small children, I have avoided the mindset that it is too late for me to learn.

* I still struggle applying the growth mindset to scenarios that I feel like are limited by my personality or innate traits. For example, I get really nervous when public speaking, and am not a very skilled orator. Although I've heard that this is a skill that improves with practice, I have a hard time seeing past the limitations I feel based on my introverted nature. I tend to fall into the trap of thinking that even with practice, I will only ever be "ok" at a skill like this.

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

I use the Discover credit card app a lot, which probably uses arrays for the transactions made on my card within a statement period. For example, the array could possibly read something like januaryCharges[124.32,12.03,44.89,101.12]. Charges to the card are always divided by statement period on the app, so it makes sense to me that they would use an array for each period to limit the transactions that you are viewing at a time.

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

An array method is a specific action that can be performed on an array that has a specified output. An array method changes the array in some way, be it adding new elements or changing their order.

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

The purpose of a loop is to direct a computer to execute a certain function a set (or not) number of times, rather than having to manually repeat the function in your code.

You would use a loop in conjunction with an array if the function the loop executes involves the elements of an array. This means that each time the function executes (with each value of i), the element included in the execution of the function will change because it is associated with a value of i (which is the index value of the array).

If you don't have multiple items/elements/values for the loop to execute on, then you would not use the loop in conjunction with an array, and i would not correspond to an element's index.

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

A loop lets a computer know that it should do something over and over again, until some specific condition changes. Imagine that you are helping your dad build a wall out of bricks, and the bricks need to be carried from the back of the car to the yard. Rather than saying "Go pick up a brick and carry it to the yard" over and over for each brick, your dad might say "Go pick up a brick and carry it to the yard, and then go back and get another brick and do it again until you have moved all of the bricks over." In this scenario you are the computer, your dad is the code, and there being no more bricks left in the car is the condition that says that your chore is done.

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?

In regards to the question about when you'd use a loop in conjunction with an array vs. without-- I'm not sure if there is something to this that I am missing. From my research, I wasn't really able to find an answer beyond "use a loop with an array when you have an array".
