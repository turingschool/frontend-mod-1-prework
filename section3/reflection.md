## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
- It sounds really silly and I'm not sure how to explain it properly, but I never thought of coding as something you practice. I understand it now since I've started Mod 0 at Turing. Coding is just like learning any other language so why wouldn't I have to practice? But I suppose I was thinking of it like learning a software like SalesForce - You play with it a little until you figure it out, then boom! You've got it! Silly I know, but going through mod 0 and reading the article for this section, the practice portion really resonated with me.
- I love (and plan to put a little post-it with this behind my computer) the section about practicing SMART goals. I love making to-do lists, but often they're just long lists of all the things I can think of that I need to do. Just a mind dump of little and giant to dos in no specific order. Using these "SMART" goal steps, I think I will be able to navigate my to-dos and balance my time so much better.
- I also especially love the point about spending time debugging. I've run into some issues with the practice exercises and I spent quite a bit of time trying to figure out the issue, just to find it was a really silly mistake or easy fix. Each time I'd think to myself, "Wow what a waste of time!" This article helped me realize that this is just part of the learning process!

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
- I think I'm pretty good at accepting critical feedback. After writing quite a few papers in grad school, I had to deal with a lot (sometimes harsh) feedback from many professors. I know though that they're spending time to write out this feedback to help me in the long run though! So, I've learned to get comfortable with it. An area I know that I need to develop more regarding growth mindset is is perseverance when I face really challenging situations. I have done some really challenging things and have succeeded, but I have a terrible habit of procrastinating when I know things will get really difficult. I work well under pressure and I will say that I'm tricking myself into working harder. But in reality, I'm just adding extra and unnecessary pressure and stress, when clearly it is a situation that I'm already stressed about. I think using the SMART goals and setting better/more flexible deadlines for myself will help a lot!

3. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.
- Any website or app that has a username login. If you need a unique username to sign up for this website/app, then they would need an array with all of the taken usernames to filter through to ensure that a new user isn't taking another user's username.

4. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
- An array method is kind of like a shortcut to modifying an array. For example, you can add/remove the first or last element in an array.

5. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
- A loop is a way to write a single code to run a more complicated code a certain number of times. We use loops with an array to perform those actions on a collection of strings, numbers, etc. We would use a loop without an array to run the code with indices or operations with the indices.

6. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
- A loop is an easy way to the same thing a bunch of times. So we can count numbers or sing words to a song over and over by using this trick that we only have to do once.

7. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
- I'm a little confused about the last exercise in loops.js. I initially got it right except I put "var i = 11" in the initialization portion of my for loop because I assumed that that would actually be position 10, but that printed 11 through 1. So I'm wondering why I would put 10 here for it to print 10-1 when index 11 is actually 10.
