## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
* It is okay to get things wrong.  If I had already mastered JavaScript, I would not be enrolled at Turing.  By making mistakes, and then going through the process of fixing a mistake, I am solidifying concepts in my brain.  With code, mistakes are inevitable, so I need to get comfortable with the process of iterating through code that doesn't work until it is correct.  I tend to avoid things that I am not great at right away, so this part of the growth mindset is very important to me because I can't just avoid concepts that don't click right away.  I need to reread material and practice until the concept makes sense to me.  

* It is important to seek out challenges.  The brain is a muscle, and the more I challenge it the stronger it will get.  With coding, there are always new things to learn and more efficient ways to do things.  The job of a developer is to solve problems.  The more comfortable I get taking challenges head on, the better off I will be in this industry.  

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
* When I started Turing I accepted the fact that I know nothing about coding.  Each topic has been brand new to me.  I have been very good at reading through material and practicing material until it clicks in my brain.  I am not afraid to ask questions if that helps me learn the material.  

* I am having an issue with time management.  There are a lot of moving parts in my life, so I am very used to going with the flow.  I take care of my family first, and then focus on the things that I need to get done.  In order to be successful, I need to block hours in the day where my family can accommodate me and my schedule.  I don't think it will work if I continue to study late at night once my kids are in bed while still waking up early to get them ready for school.  

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

* In my Fierce45 App, I would think they probably use an array to store all of the classes I have attended.  At the top of the app it has a counter that displays the number of classes completed.  When you click on it, you can see that dates and times of those classes.  

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

* Array methods are functions that are built into JavaScript that allow us to change/edit our arrays without having to create the functions on our own.  For now we re using the array methods:
 - pop- removes the last element from an array
 - push- adds one or more elements to the end of an array
 - shift- removes the first element from an array
 - unshift- adds one or more elements to the beginning of an array


1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

* Loops are used when we want a program to carry out an action multiple times, but we only want to write the code for that action once.  (The loop will run until the code returns 'false'.)  We use loops in conjunction with arrays when we want to perform an action on each item of a collection.  

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
*  A loop tells the computer that as long as something is true, to keep doing it.  An example would be, "if your cut is bleeding, put a tissue on it."  Once your cut stops bleeding you no longer put a tissue on it.  

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?

* I am curious to see a loop in conjunction with an array in a real life application.  I have been reading so much text I am having a hard time imagining how they would work in a web page or app.  I definitely have some googling to do!
