## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

A few elements of the growth mindset literature resonated with me. One of these points was the perspective shifting on "mistakes". Thinking of a mistake not as a bad thing, but instead as a learning opportunity feels powerful. I am someone who is typically quite hard on myself, so shifting my perspective in this way will benefit my growth rather than allow myself to stunt my learning through taking time to reprimand myself. Embracing mistakes in this way could also make me more willing to try new things and take on new challenges (another one of the blog post author's points). If I fail, it is not a *bad* thing, but a necessary step on the way to deeply learning something. In this way, facing obstacles becomes a new opportunity, rather than a scary and daunting ordeal.

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

One of the reasons I felt that I could take on learning this brand new skill was an introduction to the growth mindset's view that you can do anything through effort and practice. Learning this gave me the freedom to explore where I wanted to go next in my career without limitations of 'what I'm good at." In my case, starting on the Turing journey has been with an understanding that it will take a lot of grit and willingness to persevere and continue learning even during times of adversity.

Something I could continue to improve is my willingness to as for help. I lie that the growth mindset teachings not only say this is okay to do, but embrace it as a sign of strength instead of weakness. It is difficult to do things lie asking for help in our cohort slack channels, but I do understand how this can save a ton of time in programming and plan to continue improving in this way.

3. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

Arrays are likely used for Instagram feeds. The posts that populate in your page's feed must be stored in an array to make them easily accessible for viewing as a group when someone clicks on your profile page.

4. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

Array methods are built in functions in Javascript that help to perform a change to an array. Array methods we used in this lesson add or remove elements from the beginning or ends of arrays. Javasript has a "shortcut" written in to help us do these things through code instead of manually changing the array.

5. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

The purpose of a loop is to tell the computer to iterate the same action a specific number of times. When used in conjunction with an array, a loop can iterate different data throughout the array and apply it to the code the loop executes. If an array is not used, the computer can repeat the same process multiple times, but new information is not introduced since it is working with the same singular variable and not running through a set of information. For example, a loop without an array could produce the same message "Happy birthday, Kara!", three times. With an array introduced, an almost identical loop could incorporate multiple names to say happy birthday to 3 different people "Happy birthday, Kara!", "Happy birthday, Tim!", "Happy birthday, Jon!"

6. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

A loop tells a set of code to repeat itself over and over again. It will do this as many times as you (the programmer) tell it to.

7. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
- What would different types of loops (aside for the for loop) be used for?
- What would be a use case for entering different types of data in an array?
- Instead of entering i++ or i-- in a loop's condition set, is there a way to count up or down by more than 1? Woudl there ever be a reason to do so?
