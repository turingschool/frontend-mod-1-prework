## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?  
   1. Something that really resonated with me was the concept that capabilities are simply where you are now. These don't have to be, and aren't, part    of your identity in a very fixed and unchangeable way. These capabilities can and will grow and change.  

   1. See progress that you are making and celebrate that but don't see difficult moments or concepts (when you hit that gridlock and don't understand something) as defeating. Don't let them become moments that make you quit and give up. These are examples of what you need to work on. See them as opportunities for growth.  

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?  

   1. I think I'm getting better over the years at persevering in the face of difficulties. I used to think that most people were successful because they were innately skilled at something or were smarter. I don't think that anymore. If you want to learn something you can learn it and you just keep taking a step forward and learn a little more, then a little more, and little more...until one day you wake up and you know a whole lot more than you did before. It takes time and perseverance and that's something I'm a whole lot more patient with now (being in my late thirties helps with this).
   1. Something I need to work on: not comparing my process and my growth to others -- only to myself. It can be easy to be discouraged when you look at your peers (or observe a professional in the field). You see that you have so far to go, in comparison. The reality is, as long as you're learning, you know more than you knew before (compare yourself to yourself). If this is the case then you are succeeding and growing.  

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.  

   1. I believe an array would be used by a developer to perhaps hold a list of users on a website. When a particular user logged in JavaScript would access that username in the array and would then run code associated with that user.

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.  

   1. An array method is code that we can include to retrieve information/items (use it) or change information/items contained in the array. These would be things like .push, .pop, .shift, .unshift, .length, and .split(). Each of these methods allows us to alter our array, allows us to obtain information, and allows us to use specific information.  

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?  

   1. A loop is used when we want to perform a repetitive action. A loop keeps our code much more succinct and polished (instead of perhaps writing out console.log thousands of times). We would use a loop in conjunction with an array when we want to run through all of the items in a list. We can use a loop with an array to print out different messages (or use items in the the array in specific ways) depending on what the value of each item is in our array. We would use a loop without an array when we need an iteration to repeat an action a certain amount of times.

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?  

   1. A loop is when we ask our computer program to do something for a certain amount of times. It's like if I asked you to lift your leg one time. Then I asked you to lift your leg again. Then I asked you to lift your leg again. Then I asked you to lift your leg again. Instead of saying this four times in a row, I could just ask you once, to lift your leg four times. This would be a much simpler way to do things and would take up less time. In our computers it takes up less space to when you write a command one time...especially if you had to write something out one billion times in a row.

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?  

   1. I think I understand that the code block (inside of the curly braces) can get get much more complex. I have questions about how this would be written. I'm wondering about how you write more complex mathematical equations, especially if you're using concatenation and the plus operator stands for linking variable names and strings but what if you need it to perform addition between two items in an array? Do you have to encase that part of the code in parentheses, in order to perform addition, so that the interpreter doesn't read it as concatenation? This is something I'm going to experiment with myself.  

   1. I also just have a lot of questions about where arrays and loops are used. Our textbook mentioned that loops can slow the browser down if they contain a lot of items to loop through, and a lot of code to execute. I'm still so limited in my understanding about how complex these loops could get.
