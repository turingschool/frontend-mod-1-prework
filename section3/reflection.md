## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

One of the points that really resonated with me was the idea that making mistakes is a good thing and a learning experience. This is something I have already started to realize when making mistakes in my own code, making a mistake and being forced to debug and change certain parts of code has really helped me learn some of the syntax that I was making mistakes with early on. One that is brand new is this idea of the Zone of Proximal development. The idea that you are slowly pushing your knowlege and comfort level further and further by dippong your toes into areas that you are not that familiar with, is very interesting to me and makes me feel a little better about feeling like im venturing into deep water.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

I can be content to sticking within my comfort zone, this is something that I have been trying to work on and it is one of the reasons I wanted to get started on my turing journey. I understand that pushing through the comfort zone is the best way to broaden horizons and grow as a person, but it can be hard to make yourself do. It is also sometimes difficult for me to ask questions for imaginary fear of criticism.

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

In a shopping app like amazon, lists of similar items or sale items could be organized in an array when you make a search. For example if you search for "television" amazon will likely present you with an array of different televisions.

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

An array method is a built in function of javascript that allows you to manipulate items within an array. They are represented as arrayName.method where arrayName is the name of your array and method is the name of the method you want to call on the array such as "length".

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

The purpose of a loop is to do the same thing over and over for a desired amount of iterations. We would use a loop in conjunction with an array if we wanted to iterate through all of the items in the array and display them or make some change to each of them. We would use a loop without an array if we wanted to print out a single string or do calculations on a single number multiple times perhaps with differnt values of i.

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

I would show a 5 year old a loop in their shoelaces and explain how the starting point is also the ending point, and that in the middle of the start and the end are instructions that we want to follow (maybe could actually write them out on the shoelace). Then I would have them turn the loop and read the instructions.

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?

Are there different kinds of loops besides the for loop? How can they be used?
