## Section 3 Reflection


### What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?


*The part of the article talking about zone of proximal development resonated with me as something I have been very aware of in the role of a teacher for the last several years and was interesting to reconsider in the context of a student now. I think I have some good insight into how to leverage what I understand about learning already to help myself in learning coding. I also loved when in the video they talked about not comparing yourself to others. Sometimes I have a hard time with this, and I think it will be helpful to remember the advice to track my own progress and see my own growth*



### In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?


*I currently treat mistakes as critical to learning and don't really worry too much about failure. I take challenges head on. I need to work on not comparing myself to others*



### Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.


*Developers probably use arrays in games to keep track of online players playing in the same world. Arrays would also be used to store user accounts and shopping lists in individual accounts.*



### In your own words, explain what an Array method is.


*An array method is a command done on an array of data. For example, calling the method .length on an array will evaluate how many items or values are in the array.*



### What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?


*The purpose of a loop is to write code for an action just one time, but be able to carry it out multiple times. The can be done if I want to run the same message a certain number of times. This can be done with a collection of data, such as an array, where you may want to run the same code on each data point. For example, if I wanted to calculate the sales tax on an array of differently priced items.*



### If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?


*A loop is a way of telling a computer how many times you want it to do the same thing over and over. I only have to explain the directions once, but it will do it as many times as I want.*



### What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?


*What do you do if you accidentally create and get stuck in an infinite loop?*
