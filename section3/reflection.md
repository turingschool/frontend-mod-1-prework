## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
- Having a growth mindset is entering into a learning process that I can and will grow and improve. My capabilities are not fixed or set.
-I feel that the classical musician environment I grew up in allowed me to be aware, evaluate, and breakdown a problem to widdle away towards a solution.

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
-There were a few moments in Mod 0 that were intimidating. There were students who have a much more solid foundation in javascript and the technical terminology than myself. I felt myself growing a little self-conscious of my abilities, but I then leaned on those people when I needed help or questions answered. Viewing them not as "competition" or people to compare myself to, but rather as people who could teach or help me was a growth mindset shift I made.

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.
-As a teacher I use an exam program called Edulastic. When I create multiple choice questions, I think that options A, B, C, D are arrays the software loops through to asses if it is set as a correct answer or a wrong answer.

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
An array method is a command that manipulates the items in an array.

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
A loop is an action that the developer wants carried out a certain amount of times. If we are wanting to loop through a collection of data, we would want to loop through an array, but if we want to loop through numbers we don't necessarily want that to always be an array.

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
A loop is a single action (like "jump") that we want done a certain amount of times ("jump 5 times"). If we loop through an array, it's telling that action to repeat at every item in the array ("Jump through the door, jump through the hoop, jump through the curtain").

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
I'm wondering when/how/if a loop could be used in conjunction with a function (I suppose you could do this when users are inputting more items to an array?).
