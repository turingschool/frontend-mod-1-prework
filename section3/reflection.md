## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
One point that resonated with me was "when you see mistakes as critical to learning, you won't feel discouraged when you make a mistake" learning to accept and grow from my mistakes instead of getting upset and flustered will help me grow as a programmer. The second point that stuck out was "those with a growth mindset are less likely to avoid a challenge" and the "practice of coding is inherently challenge-seeking". I need to embrace the challenges to learn and grow as a developer on my journey.
1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
I currently demonstrate a growth mindset by setting myself "S.M.A.R.T" goals to accomplish the tasks and assignments given to me in Mod 0 and the prework for Mod 1. This helps me so I don't wait till last minute to get things accomplished. I need to grow in embracing the challenge and the mistakes that have come and will be coming. I am a perfectionist, and I need to learn this is a continual place of growth and not to beat myself up over things.
1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.
I think bank apps use examples of arrays to display different expenses in someones account. I think this because it would make it simple for them to show the expenses listed with an array and loop it through so the computer can manually do it.
1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
An array method is how an array is written. There are two different formats an array can be written which is array literal and array constructor. An array literal is the preferred way to write it, and it uses brackets whereas an array constructor uses parentheses.
1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
The purpose of a loop is a way to write the code once, but have the program carry it so many specified times. We use a loop in conjunction with an array when we have an x amount of things needed to add to a certain statement or to do math for us, etc. A loop being used without an array is only having one item or statement that needs to do something so many times.
1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
I would teach the five year old that a loop is an easy way for you to write something one time and make it do that action so many times needed. For example, if you wanted to tell your brother everyday to do your chores for you and only have to say it one time wouldn't that be nice. Same thing goes with wanting to use a loop.
1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
There is no question at this current time I can think of.
