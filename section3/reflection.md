## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
S.M.A.R.T was a new concept I learned during the readings. I'm going to take this tip with me to help me break down huge coding projects into smaller, easier to digest projects. Focusing on the processes also really resonated with me. I'm always so focused on trying to get the coding right, rather than focusing on what worked or didn't work.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
I demonstrate growth mindset by knowing that mistakes are essential to learning (and I a make a ton). I'm not afraid of making mistakes and welcome them when they come. Getting things wrong helps me remember how to do them right. I don't demonstrate growth mindset because I don't seek out challenges very often. I am comfortable doing things that are easy.

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.
Facebook probably uses arrays often. The friends list is an example of an array used in Facebook.

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
An array method manipulates the elements in an array. It could delete the first element of the array, delete the last element of the array
etc.

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
The purpose of a loop is to repeat an action a certain number of times in a program. You would use a loop with an array if you wanted to loop the elements in the array. You would use a loop on its own if you want to repeat a string a certain number of times.

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
Loops tell the computer to do something a certain number of times.

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
How many elements are used in arrays in real world (work) codes?
