## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

I found it insightful how setting S.M.A.R.T goals can help break down projects into manageable chunks, in order to help manage the work load and finish projects in a timely manner. I think this might be easier said than done, especially just starting out, however it would be beneficial to start working on this skill sooner than later.
I also found the zone of proximal development to be interesting and how little by little you should begin to expand your knowledge base with challenges that will help you hone your current knowledge and skills and expand on them more by using a process of reflection, trial and error to solidify what you know works while solving coding issues.


1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

Just trying to complete this Mod 1 pre-work I have felt like I have done a ton of reflection and trial and error to get through the unfamiliar material, most of which has been fun (although challenging). I feel like I continue to struggle with some set backs and when stumped for too long tend to get discouraged slightly. When this happens, I just take a break and get back to it with fresh eyes.

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

Developers most likely utilize arrays for a social media followers list. An array would be able to store all followers of a given user's account in one place to keep that user's followers organized and easier to manage.

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

An array method is a way to store date in a collection for later use within the program.

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

The purpose of a loop is to be able to repeat lines of code without having to type out each individual line of code by hand.

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
A loop is like an alarm clock with a snooze feature, where the alarm will repeat every 5 minutes until you turn it off.

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?

Can you have a loop within a loop?
