## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

   * Two points from the Growth Mindset article/ video that really resonated with me are:
     1. It is important to be primarily concerned with comparing your current self with your past self rather than with other people. This helps you to focus on your own progress rather than on how you are doing relative to everyone around you. The difference is that you know the work that you have put in, but you have no idea what other people have been up to. You never know when someone else is doing better or worse than you because of previous experience or lack of experience or something else that is going on in their life.
     2. Another important takeaway for me is that it is important to take time to reflect and appreciate your progress. It is one thing to acknowledge that you have made progress from where you were previously, it is another to take time to celebrate that progress.
     3. Also, I really appreciated the idea of having a growth mindset thought process for encountering challenges.
        1. First step is to acknowledge that you don't know something or are facing a challenge and accept that that's okay.
        2. Next step is to have a sense of curiosity about the problem, try to break down the problem, and then specifically identify what you don't understand.
        3. Then you should try to practice understanding the concept you are having trouble with or try another way of solving a piece of the problem you are having trouble with.


1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

   * I currently demonstrate growth mindset through my openness to struggle and challenge, my patience with repetition, my instinct to innovate and try new approaches to problems, and through my reflections on all the times I have successfully used growth mindset. It has played a large role in my life over the past 6 years.

   * I do not demonstrate growth mindset when I have a hard time admitting that I don't know or understand something. Sometimes it is easier to pretend I fully understand something than it is to acknowledge I may not entirely understand something, and should spend time working on that.


1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

   * Google Maps might store all of the locations you have visited in an array that is associated with your username. The address or coordinates of each location you have visited are stored as strings or numbers in a list connected to your Google Account. This array is used to suggest recommendations for future locations to go to, to verify reviews you write about locations to ensure you visited there, and maybe it is sold to advertisers for better ad targeting.


1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

   * Array methods are special functions that either use or modify the elements of an array.


1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

   * A loop allows you to run the same line of code multiple times without having to write the code multiple times. You would use an array in conjunction with an array when you want to use elements of that array as part of what your loop is operating on or if your loop is using an array to determine how many times it should run the loop. It is especially useful when you don't know how many times you are going to be running a loop. You would use a loop without an array when you know how many times you are running a loop.


1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

   * A loop is a way to make a computer do the same thing over and over and over and over again as many times as you want without having to tell it over and over again. You only have to tell it once. If I could program your brain (5 year old I am speaking to) to clean your room at the same time every day without me having to tell you over and over again then I would be using a loop. I would program all 5 year olds with loops if I could.


1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?

   * My only question is in the for loop example of `for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++)` at what point does i change values. I am assuming it changes values right before the loop evaluates the condition again and right after the code block runs rather than before the code block runs. Its a little confusing since it seems like the computer skips the `i++` statement until after it reads the code block.
