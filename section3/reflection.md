## Section 3 Reflection

**1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?**

I've used SMART goals at work, for both myself and staff, and have found them to be very effective.  I've never applied them to learning or education though, so this will be a new use of SMART goals for me. I think the tricky part will be to develop SMART goals that aren't just re-statements of the curriculum already established, but rather that somehow builds and extends from that curriculum.  

One of the things from the video that resonated with me is the need to track my own progress.  It's something I did broadly in my previous job, but I'm starting a daily log for my time at Turing.  Hopefully this will give me a good map of my progress and points of comparison as I move through the intense program.

**2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?**

I already believe in my ability to learn, adapt, and grow -- my career trajectory shows that I haven't followed one path but instead took risks to learn new skills and try to master new areas.  Going to Turing is another example of this, and shows a willingness to take on new challenges with the belief that I can succeed.  

Some ways I don't demonstrate the growth mindset is that I still struggle to contain negative thoughts and self-doubt. I know I can sometimes get hung up on a perceived lack of quick progress and I'm not always good at looking back at things I've achieved successfully.  I'm attempting to remedy this in a few ways, one of which is to log my daily work including things I've learned/overcome.  My thinking is that I'll have a nice retroactive view of what I've accomplished each day, which should help sustain me moving forward.

**3. What is something you are good at or knowledgeable at now, that you once weren't? How did you get those skills/knowledge? Was it hard at some point?**

When I started my last couple of positions, I worked in Public Health but I starting knowing almost nothing about Public Health.  By the time I left my most recent position, I was recognized as an expert and thought leader in Public Health.  I mostly got there with the help of good mentors, trial-and-error, and my own studying on a variety of topics.  I very much appreciated having the opportunity to develop relationships with mentors and the amount of education that was made available to me if I wanted to pursue it.  It was pretty hard at first as there was so much to learn (I had a ten page printout of excel sheets that was just acronyms).  Driving myself to learn, and getting help from mentors, was a huge part of being able to move from amateur to expert in that field.

**4. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.**

Arrays are good for storing a lists, so it seems like shopping carts on websites/apps probably use an array to store all the items you have in the cart.  It's easy to add and remove items, as well as print them all out or recall them when they're in an array.  Whenever you add something to your cart, it is added to the array.  If you return something out of your cart, it's removed from the array.  Once items are purchased, they are all emptied out of the cart array.  

**5. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.**

Array methods seem to be built-in codes/operations that each perform specific actions on an array.  For example, array.pop() can be used to remove the last (i.e. right-most) element from an array.  This method appears to be a built-in command that JavaScripts knows and can execute.  From what I've read and seen so far, array methods are all structured as the array name, followed by a period and the method name (or at least all of those we've used and I've found have this structure).  Some of the array methods have additional options, such as array.push() allowing you to add one or more elements.

**6. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?**

A loop is a way to repeat code a specific number of times or until a specific condition is met.  This is a way to create multiple iterations, and can automate some functions (*e.g.* having the console to log a series of messages without having to manually time out each message, as was done in the exercises).  We'd use a loop in conjunction with an array when we need to iterate through the items in an array.  For example, if you had an array of ten items you wanted to log out individually, you could iterate to reduce the amount of code/work it requires (as opposed to console logging each array position one at a time manually).  You could use a loop without an array in cases where you wanted to loop through something other than an array.  For example, you could loop through a series of numbers to log them individually, only log the odd numbers within a certain range, or to print multiple console logs of the same message.   

**7. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?**

Loops are a way for code to repeat, but not forever.  It's like asking someone to pick up the toys off the floor -- they should keep picking up the toys until there are no many on the floor, and once they've been picked up, they can stop.

**8. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?**

The MDN has a large list of array.methods so I really want to dig into those to see what all the available options are, though it seems a bit overwhelming.  

The reading brought up three kinds of loops: for, while, and do..while.  I'm curious about the last two and have questions about how those are coded and used, but I can look up that information on my own (or perhaps it's part of a future lesson).

Finally, in a couple examples of arrays there were mixed data types.  Is this something you see often in software engineering?  It seems conceptually odd to me that you would have a situation like that.  Maybe an array of personal info which could include name, age, married status?
