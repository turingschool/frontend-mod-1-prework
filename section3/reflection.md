## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

1. The point about setting S.M.A.R.T. goals really resonated with me. I sometimes struggle tackling a big project because I haven't broken it up into smaller and more realistic tasks.
2. The other point that really resonated with me was the one about how mistakes are essential to learning. I have definitely learned that the hard way while going through some of these prework exercises. If I hadn't made a ton of mistakes, especially in this section, I wouldn't have learned or researched nearly as much.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

I currently embody that I will improve on my coding skills as long as I'm consistently putting in effort and practice to become better. I personally know I have been putting in a lot of time and effort while I've been in class or working on homework. I do this because I want to be the best version of myself that I can be while I'm in this program.

I would say the hardest one for me to adapt to and embody would be seeking help. I'm very stubborn and usually want to try and tackle problems by myself, but in a program like this, everything only benefits me by asking questions or for help. 

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

An online store such as Gymshark, uses arrays by having different collections of items you can buy while using their site. Different types of arrays on their website might be like, "Sweatshirts" and then it holds all of the different sweatshirts.

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

An array is used to hold a collection or list of different elements.

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

A loop is used to repeat a command as many times as needed. It's used in conjunction with arrays by **iterating** through the list and can perform functions with the elements inside of the array.

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

It is a tool used to repeat something as many times as someone wants.

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?

I am still learning and understanding the different types of loops such as "do while" or "for in" and when to utilize them best. Is there a type of loop that you use more often than others? How often will I be using all of the different types of loops in a real situation?
