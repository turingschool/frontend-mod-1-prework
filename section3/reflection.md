## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

I appreciated the point about the growth mindset that stated the importance of believing that you can improve your coding skills with effort and practice, also stating that growth-minded individuals may be more apt to practice more often. Believing that you can improve and grow is essential to developing intentional habits to make progress towards that growth.

I also enjoyed reading about the importance of not being afraid to ask for help. They stated that how this can actually expedite the learning process. I seek to continue to become engaged with the programming community.

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

Currently, I demonstrate a growth mindset by believing I have agency and impact on what I can learn and how I can grow. Knowing that I'm not only "x" smart and can't get any smarter, motivates me to continue learning and growing. I recognize that everyone has to start somewhere, so why not today?

I would like to improve in not believing that I'm as smart as other people because I learn at a different pace or way, but to be more creative in how I structure my time and methods of practice that actually work for me.

3. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

I think about using the mobile application Strava. This stores weekly mileage of biking or running by calendar week. An example of an array could be each week that contains a list of miles per day (values).

4. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

An array method performs an action or change to an array. Each method has a specific function that is built into it.

5. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

A loop allows us to only write code one time but lets that action be performed more than one time. We would want to use a loop in an array if we want to perform a certain action on each item in an array. We might use a loop without an array if we want the same action to be completed multiple times on one piece of data.

6. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

A loop lets us do only one thing but it happens multiple times. Like when you bounce a basketball, you only have to dribble it once but it keeps bouncing on its own.

7. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?

I would like to continue to get comfortable with the syntax of arrays and loops and combining if statements with these. How exactly is a while loop different than a for loop?
