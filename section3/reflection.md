## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
I really enjoyed the Zone of Proximal Development as an account of broadening one's skillset, I had never considered how our challenges tend to come in families and progress incrementally rather than epochally.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
I definitely do not shy away from challenges but I am definitely having trouble seeking help in this pre work.

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.
Arrays are used in any situation where a set of data points needs to be organized for interpolation based on a common attribute.
I always use "User Reviews this Year" from letterboxd as an example.

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
An array method is a property of the array that you wish to output.

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
The purpose of a loop when we wish to apply a function to every element of an array in turn.

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
It's like when you want to clear your email and instead of clicking on every individual message you hit "Select All". It helps us apply a single change over many elements

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?

I spent three hours on the final exercise and couldn't crack it.
