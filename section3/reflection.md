## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

+ I sort of assumed that people who had growth mindsets have always been that way. However, both the article and the video showed me that there is sort of a _lightbulb_ moment where you switch over to that mindset.
The next thing that stood out was so obvious that I never really thought about it- we are not born knowing what we know. We must work towards learning it. Having a growth mindset is about intention and follow through. Knowing that growth is work and that mistakes are lessons is an asset to achieving your goals. Also, resign to the idea that growth does not end, it just constantly evolves.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

+ I suppose the leap I took in signing up for Turing serves as an indicator that I've started on the path of embracing a growth mindset. I am creating the space in my life for practice, experimentation, and learning. A big part of why I chose Turing is because it focuses on these aspects rather than just working off of a checklist of tasks.

I have resigned to not continuing a growth mindset in a few of my hobbies, namely playing the guitar. When I was in college, I studied this instrument and put a lot of time and experimentation into learning it. Now that my goals and priorities have changed, this hobby has lost priority in my day-to-day life.

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

I use an app called Poshmark that is a marketplace to find quality used clothing. In my profile I have my sizes saved, likely in an array. I also have a list of brands that I _follow_ which are likely held as strings in an array. Furthermore, my shipping information is likely held in an array. When I post a listing, I will upload several pictures of which the image urls are held in an array. Arrays are everywhere!

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

+ Array methods are ways to manipulate the data that is stored in an array. Different methods will add, subtract, or modify data in specific ways (such as adding data to the front index of the array for example.) These methods will come in handy when we need to figure out specific ways to change the data inside the array braces.

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

+ We use loops when we want the code to do the grunt work of iterating through a list. A great example in the video we watched was logging the numbers 1 through 10 onto the console. We could type out a console log for each number manually, but even with copy and pasting that is tedious and makes the code look sloppy. We can simply create a condition for it to work through an array of data. This is handy for long or complex arrays where human error is likely. It also seems helpful if the data in the array is dynamic and changing.

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

+ Loops are like simple instructions we give our program to do on their own that saves us time. We can control what the instructions are and how many times they are given.  

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?

+ When we create loops that iterate over arrays with multiple data types inside, do we have to use if/else if statements to control how it is iterated over? I suppose this would depend on exactly how we were trying to manipulate our data... Also, can we have simultaneous loops working off of the same array at the same time, or do we simply need to duplicate the array to be used with another loop?
