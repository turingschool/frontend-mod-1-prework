## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
    -I didn't realize how much learning how to program can affects other aspects of your growth. I've always tried to find ways to "foster growth oriented behaviors such as goal setting, effective effort, and motivation" in order to become a better coder. It seems that both work mutually in harmony.
    -Carmen Popuviciu mentioned that if she's feeling like there is no progress being made then she will just call it a night to sleep on it. I've incorporated sleeping on things to connect synapse connections to be extremely valuable. Its great to know every very experience developers value sleeping on things.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
    I've been the sort of person to adapt to adjust to my needs. I have no issue with change because I view it as rapid evolution to my growth as a person. However, I've been fixed minded on many subjects. I've always considered myself doomed when it came to certain topics, like math. I didn't realize that I was just boxing myself in from letting my potential come out.

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.
    Netflix uses a lot of arrays. When you select a genre and an array of movies are sorted through. Or when you view what actors are in the movie, or what genres the movie is, and array is used to make those lists.

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
    An array method is a way to alter or transform an array.

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
    A loop is used to save on time and redundancy. It allows you to repeat calculations or create lists. We would use loops if we need to iterate each element within the array. You wouldn't use it if you only needed to something with the array once.

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
    A loop is when your kindergarten teacher calls out everyones name to make sure you are present. She will start off with calling Billy first because his name was first on the list. And then she will keep calling out the next names in order that they are in the list. Once she gets to the last name, she will know when to stop calling out names and then class can continue.

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
    None currently.
