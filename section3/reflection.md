## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

- I really liked the notion that growth-minded individuals are more likely to practice often, accept feedback and criticism, and are able to handle difficult situations. When you know that you're entering an industry of constant change and constant learning, I imagine adopting this mindset as soon as possible will make life much easier, since these things seem sort of inevitable. Another thing I liked was embracing challenge. Again, this appears to be an industry where challenges are constant, and looking forward to overcoming challenges rather than being deterred by them probably makes things a little easier. You know they're coming so just lean into it!

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

- I think I currently am getting good at mistakes are essential to learning. Earlier today, I was **STRUGGLING** and trying a million different things. In that process, I learned a lot of what does, and does not work, and it helped me know what to do when I encounter that same problem again later. As frustrated as I was, I learned a lot in the process and eventually (whew!) arrived to an answer. Some ways I do *not* currently demonstrate a growth mindset is still being fully comfortable seeking help. Not only is that difficult for me in this situation, but I'd say in most life situations I tend to not want to "burden" people with my questions. I'm learning more and more every day that my questions are never a burden, and that they're essential to my learning and also can help others learn with me.

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

- An example of a web application that probably uses arrays would be a clothing store! I can see how having a list of available colors, a list of recently viewed items, a list of shopping cart items, could all be examples of arrays. They're everywhere!!

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

- **Array methods** are things that you can do to an array. We can sort them, reverse them, remove elements from them, add elements to them, etc.

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

- The purpose of a loop is to prevent us from having to type the same information over and over again. Instead of physically doing that, we can use a loop! We use loops in conjunction with arrays when we want to display or access all of the elements in an array quickly. When we use loops without arrays, we probably want to count something or repeat something.

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

- If I had to teach a 5 year old about loops, I'd likely say to them that loops are a fast way to say the same thing over and over again without having to actually say it every time. You just say it once and you can have it repeat itself as many times as you tell it to.

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?

- My questions are more about adding more complex things to the loop and the array. I feel a little uncertain when it comes to loops that require more steps.
