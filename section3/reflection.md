## Section 3 Reflection

*1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?*

A. - 1. The idea of having S.M.A.R.T goals resonates hows I have been living my life towards my late 20's. Having specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and Time-bound goal is critical to personal success. In my past experience as a real estate agent I set specific, measurable, time-bound goals on how much business I wanted to bring in. Having that barometer for success laid out before you engage in business is critical to understanding how you need to operate on a day to day basis. If I want to make X amount of money that year that would mean I would need to make X amount of calls to leads, that lead to x amount of appointments, that leads to x amount of contracts written, that leads to x amount of contracts signed and so on. What goals I want to set for myself while I begin this new chapter in my life is something I will need to think deeply about while I am at Turing.

A. - 2. Understand mistakes are essential to learning. Turing isn't the first time I've been introduced to code. I have a little experience learning code by myself in High School and College. I was a Computer Science Major in college and my first introduction to C++ was extremely difficult. I tried to use the TA and professor as much as possible but I was afraid to reach out because I was afraid I was wasting their time or that I would be outing myself for not knowing something painfully simple. This time around I need to really understand mistakes are essential and that reaching out is going to be critical for my success. I need to strike a balance between not overlying on my mentors but also not wearing myself out from not knowing what I am doing wrong.

*2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?*

A. - I think by going to Turing and reinventing myself in a new career is a way of me demonstrating a growth mindset. There was a time a few years back I thought Real Estate was the industry I would retire in. But fast forward a few years and I am not as happy as I thought I would be. Having the strength to reinvent yourself in a new career takes some setting aside of the ego and requires the ability to be humble and have the mindset that you don't have all the answers, again, anymore. Not that I ever really did but even in Real Estate there was something always more to know and learn about marketing, finance, or investing. Switching into a completely new field requires the same understanding that even though I am no longer in college, learning should never truly end if I want to succeed.

In which ways do I not exhibit a growth mindset? That is an interesting question to ask yourself. I guess in a sense me not being a morning person can be hindering to having a growth mindset. I know that if I don't have anything planned or anything to do on the weekends, I will often sleep in because I love sleep. Sleep is important but I have to plan out my week with Google calendar to make sure I have an idea of what I am doing or a reason to get up. More broadly however, I feel like I can sometimes be resistant to change because I get comfortable doing what I am doing. I feel that feeling going away as I get older and I feel the immediacy of needing to figure life and what I am going to do with it. But when things are going good and all my needs are met, I can sometimes be resistant to new changes.



*3. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.*

A. - On the side, I deliver for a company named Veho that partners with meal kit home delivery companies. When I sign up for my route, I am given a list of addresses where I will be dropping off my packages for the day. Developers most likely use an array to create the list of addresses I will be delivering to that day.

*4. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.*

A. - An Array method is a script we can use to modify an array. Array methods discussed in this section like pop, push, shift, and unshift modify the array in unique ways. With these methods we are able to remove or add objects to the array.

*5. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?*

A. - The purpose of a loop is to carry out the actions of a script multiple times without having to type out each action needed individually. A loop simplifies a script by removing the redundancies within code by giving the loop instructions on how the loop functions.

We would use a loop in conjunction with an array when we need to perform the same action to all items within an array. For example, if we were buying items from Amazon, on the checkout screen Amazon likely uses an array to check if all the items in the cart are still available to the customer before submitting the payment.

We can also use loops without arrays as well. Food delivery companies likely use a loop without an array on their website. Companies like Grub hub likely use a loop to check if a restaurant is still open. It likely periodically checks the
current time versus their closing time to make sure the customer can still place
an order before they close.


*6. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?*

A. - A loops helps us do the same action over and over instead of doing it ourselves. We can tell the loop when to start and stop and tell the loop what to do and when to do it.

*7. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?*

A. - Is it possible to have an array where each item in the array is a loop? Do arrays only store data types or can they store functions as well?
