## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

I have always heard of the SMART goals but never knew what it meant or how this could be applied to my work. I think this goal structure will help me get into the practice of setting goals and also meeting them! I plan to repeat this anagram in my notebook for each section! I also really appreciated the piece about focusing on the process. I truly enjoy learning and find that the ways in which I teach myself or retain information is more enjoyable than actually knowing the information.  

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

I really apply the zone of proximal development to most tasks I take on. I start with something that I am relatively familiar and gradually build on that knowledge. This incremental way of learning allows me to begin with content that I am more confident with and allows me to ease into new territory more comfortably.

I am not in practice of the mistakes are essential mindset. I have been in industries that did not adopt this approach and it caused much anxiety about failing. I am happy to hear that this approach is accepted and appreciated as a tool for learning. :)

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

Amazon probably uses arrays in many applications. This could be for organizing the shopping categories, listing items within a specific category, naming different site setting options, etc.

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

The methods allow you to manipulate element(s) within the array. The pop method allows you to remove the last element in the array. The push method allows you to add one or more elements to the end of the array. The shift element removes the first element from the array. The unshift element adds one or more elements to the beginning of the array.

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

The loops allow us to write code once that will instruct the program to run it as many times to check a condition as indicated. When the program hits the designated limit, the loop will stop. You would use an array in conjunction with a loop if you want to do something to every element in an array. If you do not need to check every element, you would not need an array, only the loop.

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

A loop allows someone to write one line of code and tell the computer to check that line of code a certain number of times. The program will stop re-checking the code once the outcome hits the written limit. This saves us time and lots of unneeded lines of code!

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?

It is less of a question and more of needing extra practice to ensure I understand the structure options for creating different types of loops and loops conjuncted with arrays.
