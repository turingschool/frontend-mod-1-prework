## Section 3 Reflection

*1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?*

I really enjoyed the interview with Carmen Popoviciu. It brought back some of my own memories of feeling that sense of victory when overcoming a challenge, and was reminded that the difficulty faced when taking on something new, especially if I become unnecessarily frustrated, is an indication that whatever that thing is is something I really want in my life. I'm always more confronted by my lack of understanding when I really do want the thing I'm working on to come to fruition. Even though I have an intellectual understanding of these ideas, in reality it's always so much more difficult to overcome my own frustrations.

*But* I'm also very encouraged by that! It's a small reminder that I needn't suffer, but I can instead take a meditative approach to my problems, identify what they are, and come up with a solution independent of my own feelings. It's a reminder that nothing comes quickly, and anything takes time and practice to become proficient.

It was also just a really interesting interaction to watch. I'm really interested in linguistics and how language shapes our thinking, so watching an interview between two people speaking a language that wasn't their first was fascinating. There seemed in their interaction to be a careful attention to what they were saying to get their meanings across. Or perhaps this is just the style of these two people - it really makes me hopeful that the tech world will be more open and welcoming than I'm imaginging it will be.

*1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?*

I love learning. When I was younger I wanted to stay in school forever, but the realities of being an adult stopped that from happening! So in that vein, I've always had an active sense of curiosity and wonder. I also think my love of nature keeps driving me to understand more about the physical world around us, which in turn keeps those brain juices flowing. If I'm learning something that I think has no bearing on my material reality or ability to make money, I find joy in taking in the little details and nuances of things. As an example, my plant collection has seriously grown in the last few years! I have a variety of plants from all over the world, requiring different things to thrive. When I first started, I could keep a lucky bamboo alive, and that was it. I killed every succulent, fern, or leafy plant that came into my life. But one day, I found this thing on Amazon that looked so weird I just bought it without knowing a thing about how to keep it alive. It was my gateway plant, and sparked this desire to understand the things living in my house and learn how to truly nurture their growth. It has never felt like work to keep them going, and I think that's the key for me.

I tend to set unrealistic expectations of myself, especially when taking on something new. If I think I'm not where I should be, I'm terribly hard on myself. I lose all confidence, start to shut down, or just flat out walk away from things. It seems to stem from a lack of confidence, or possibly even a lack of a solid sense of self. I also tend to compare myself to others which, again, intellectually I know is only going to keep me from doing better or seeing what I already *can* do.

*1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.*

I'm thinking the shopping cart in Amazon may use arrays to store different things. The cart is divided into sections: "Shopping Cart", "Your items", and the sponsored or suggested items boxes. The Shopping cart would store an array of items saved for checkout, and the Your items would store a separate array of items saved for later. These seem like they would be arrays because they are dynamic and can be updated at any time by the user

*1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.*

An array method is a method which acts on an array. These can be used to alter the items in the array, add/remove items, reorder, etc...

*1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?*

A loop is used to check the conditions of variables. These are useful in evaluating arrays because they can be set up to run a certain number of times, or for certain indexes within the array.

*1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?*

A loop is a tool the computer uses to decide what to do with something. Imagine you have a box, and inside that box are four toys. Each toy must be taken out of the box to find out if the toy has what the computer needs. Let's say the computer is looking for a bear. Take out the first toy. Is it a bear? If no, put it back and check the next toy. If yes, keep the bear! The computer with check all four toys until it knows whether or not each toy is a bear. You may end up with one to four bears, or no bears at all.

*1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?*

On the Happy Birtyday exercise on the loops-arrays.js exercise, I tried to chop the first two names off the list by using a `arr.slice()` before creating the `for` loop, but it didn't work. Can that only be used as part of a `console.log` command? The MDN examples all show this method being used with a  `console.log` operation
