## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
i try to understand or learn from the mistakes i make. i see where i went wrong and why it didn't work. it gives me a better understanding of the process. i tend to get a full understanding of the process so i have good comprehension on how all the components work
1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
i have been trying to ask for help more often now. i used to be scared to ask people for help because i was nervous the question i would ask would be a stupid question.

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.
  when someone you go on facebook everything that someone likes goes into a like Section.
1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
  array methods are commands you can use on an array to change the values in them

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
the purpose of a loop is to skip the process of typing the same line of code multiple times. with an array it makes it easier to
exchange one part of a string multiple times. like if its multiple peoples birthday it can display everyones birthday just by switching out the names.


1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
tell them that it will display what i want the code to do a certain amount of times i tell it to do

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
is the condition for a loop always use a number?
