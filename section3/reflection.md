## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
  * Carmen talks about how when she was struggling in school she thought that maybe she was just not good enough for the program. That resonated with me because getting stuck on trying to understand a coding concept when my peers are moving makes me think maybe this program isn't for me. I've changed careers and learned new systems and processes several times in my life, but I've never tried to do it all virtually.
  * Asking questions, or not being afraid to seek help is a sign of strength not weakness. This tactic looks good in writing, but it's proving to be a difficult one with remote learning. Not having in person communication with my teachers or peers to build relationships and get in a comfortable position to feel vulnerable and ask questions I think everyone else isn't struggling with will continue to be a challenge for me.

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
  * Focusing on the Process works for me. Everything I've had to self teach in code so far has been a process of elimination and trial and error. I don't learn by just reading, I have to try things myself to comprehend the process of how they work.
  * I need to work on understanding that mistakes are essential to learning. The pressure to pay attention to detail, and be thorough only nurtures a perfectionist mentality for me. I'm working on finding a balance between perfection and learning through mistakes.

3. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.
  * AirBnB, I would have an array of rentalProperties with two properties listed in the array.

4. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
  * An array method is an action that can be completed on an array to modify that array.

5. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
  * Loops are used to repeat actions. Loops are used on their own to make a simple list. Loops are used with an array to evaluate the variable and determine an output.

6. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
  * A loop is a robot that does something over and over for you.

7. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
  * Overall I'm looking for clarity on the syntax requirements. When we use (), {}, [] and why. Also how to know if the symbol of choice is going to work before running node, or console.
