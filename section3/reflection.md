## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
The article mentioned seeking out challenges being beneficial, finding your self in situations where you don't know what to do at first. I personally resonated with this point being that half the time I tinkering on my computer I don't really know what I am doing. This personally helps me learn a ton about different things. For example, at my old house. 4 guys all relatively big nerds or gamers, whatever you may call it, we needed a good internet package with some high speeds, and hardware that didn't crap out in the middle of the gaming session. Xfinity provided a router/modem combo piece that did an okay job most of the time, but would lag up once every hour or so. I knew the basics of home networking, but figured that there has to be a better option for hardware. I picked up 3rd party modem and router off of Amazon, and started tinkering. Exploring menus that I don't understand, and getting to know what I am working with. Instead of calling Xfinity's support to be put on hold and then have some guy that barely knows what he is doing come out to my house to fix the internet, I fixed it myself. I understood that I didn't know what to do to fix the problem at first and didn't give up on it. Instead I bought the materials I needed and learned then deployed a faster more reliable internet service for my home.

Speaking on the above and also relating it to the article read, I think that the that is most new to me is actually asking for help. I honestly think that I have learned majority of my skills on my own without the help of others, and that being set in my mind plays the deficit of not being used to asking for help. I see my time at Turing playing a role in progressing my skills asking for help.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

As contrarian as it might sound I think I have lived most of my life with growth mindset already playing a large role. I personally have failed classes and failed tests in the past. Although it's not near the same thing I apply the ways someone with a growth mindset thinks to my life already. I embrace the idea that failure is not the end of the task, but a opportunity to learn about why I failed. Beyond that I think what I need to do better is the actually doing. If I fail I take a break thats often way too long, and that has been my main problem thus far. Initiative to complete things in a timely matter will be my main thing to grow on while here at Turing.

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

In efforts to not talk about TikTok again, I scrolled through my phone and picked a random app. GoPuff is the app of choice, if unfamiliar GoPuff is snack delivery. Similar to any individual restaurant on Grubhub, or UberEats, but with any snack you could ask for delivered in less than an hour. It breaks down the snacks into categories first, which I think would be setup as an array. For example they have chips, candy, drinks, food and more. Each of those would be setup to an array. And when I click any of them, it breaks it down into actual items. The items might be organized into an array as well, each snack might have an ID stored in the array. Beyond that each individual item likely has an array of data behind it too. It would include snackname, description, price, quantityInCart, etc.

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

Although I am a bit confused on the terminology, to my understanding an array method is a way of manipulating the data inside of the array. For example using the pop method will delete the last value of the array.

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

The purpose of a loop is to run a set of commands repetitively until the process has been completed. When paired with an array, you can use the length of the array to be the number of times the code runs. If you want to use a loop without an array there are still many uses as well. For example a simple timer could be based on a loop, but has no need for a array of data if it's simply counting up.

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

If I was 5 the best way that I could make sense of it is a merry go round. When you ride the merry go round, you are literally looping around a pivot point. If fun=5 and the amount of times around takes 1 off fun each time the loop will keep spinning until fun=0. At a certain point you'll just get dizzy and your fun=0 might turn into fun = -5.

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?

Mainly terminology questions, as mentioned above. Things like array methods, I need to watch a couple videos and learn how people in a professional settings use the words. I understand what I am looking at code wise, but when commenting saying what my code does, I knew that I could have been more technical with my wording.
