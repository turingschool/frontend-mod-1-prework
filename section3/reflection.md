## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
-Knowing you limits allows you to pass them.  If you hit a wall you know what you need to work on.  
-As you move forward never forget to look back at where you started.  If you start to think you are stuck or believe you can't continue anymore, taking a look back at when you first started the journey helps show you how much progress has already been achieved.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
-I believe taking Turing boot camp is the first step in demonstrating growth mindset.  I am almost forty and never thought about learning how to code.  I have friends who are coders and I always thought you had to love coding at a very young age to be good at it.  I still have a little of that thought.  My friends began their coding journey well before high school so I am trying to break out of that mind set.

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.
-Amazon.  Some items have different colors or sizes that are probably using arrays to store the elements in a variable called colors or sizes.

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
-They are functions that can be used to manipulate arrays.

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
-Loops perform repeated tasks based on some condition.  We would use a loop if we were trying to access each element in an array.

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
-A loop is a set of instructions that tell the computer to repeatedly run some code. The loop will stop when some condition is met.

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
The most difficult part is remembering how to write the syntax for loops.
