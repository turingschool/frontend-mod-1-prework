## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

*In the blog post by Kristin Villaneuva, she mentions using SMART goals in order to help tackle large coding projects into manageable sub goals. I think this is something that I do, subconsciously. When I have a large goal, I like to write down each step and make smaller goals that will help me stay on track to complete the bigger goal. Now that I know the acronym SMART, I think it will help me be even better at this!*

*Another point that caught my eye is "don't be afraid to ask questions". This keeps coming up and it is something that I am learning and need to remember!*

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

*I love challenging myself and solving problems. This is one of the reasons why I am leaving my current job and going to Turing! I am eager to learn and put myself in a situation where I don't know anything and am going to make mistakes. Making mistakes is only going to help me learn and become a better programmer. One thing that I need to work on is not being afraid to seek help. I typically want to figure things out on my own because once I do the feeling and satisfaction is amazing! However, I know in programming, time is precious and if something is taking too long to figure out on my own, I need to ask for help!*

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

*An example would be on Amazon, they have an Array of all of different categories, such as Home, or Kitchen items.*

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
*An array is a list of like elements*
1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
*A loop is for when you want to run the same code multiple times. Instead of writing out the code over and over again, you can use a loop and tell it when to stop running the code. You can use an array in a loop if you want the code to run the same code for different elements.*

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
*A loop is when you want to run the same code for more than 1 time. The computer will run the code as many times as you tell it to.*

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
*I don't have any specific questions right now about Arrays and loops, but I think I will once I practice more!""
