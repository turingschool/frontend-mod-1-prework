## Section 3 Reflection

### 1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
+ The idea of a “brilliant engineer” does not really exist. It is not that there are not brilliant engineers, developers, painters, whatever. But rather, the skill comes from years of experience.
+ No one is smarter than another. It has to do with growth mindset.

### 2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
+ I demonstrate growth mindset by trying different things and sticking to them if they spark me. For example, I started pole dancing about two months ago. It is a difficult and painful dance form. It would have been easy for me to say “This hurts, I don’t have enough upper body strength,” and quit. But I stuck with it and got over that hurdle simply because I love it.
+ I don’t demonstrate growth mindset by tracking my progress. I often get depressed because I am not where I want to be in my life rather than acknowledging and celebrating how far I’ve come.

### 3. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.
__Site: YouTube__
- An array is used in playlists. The user places videos into a playlist and the array is kept chronologically unless the user dictates otherwise.
- Array is used in the comment threads as well as the comments themselves. They are listed out according to most popular and chronologically.
-There is a community feature on YouTube where users are able to create posts with photos and some text. These are listed out chronologically from newest to oldest.

### 4. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
+ Array methods are unique ways to make changes to or perform calculations on an array without having to alter the code step by step. Using array methods, you can remove and/or add elements in specific placements or even
make an equation using the elements.

### 5. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
+ Loops are useful because we are able to iterate different elements an infinite or specific number of times.
In other words, loops are helpful to access each individual element in an array and perform the same action for each element in an array. If loops didn't exist, we would have to repeat actions for each value.
+ A loop is not useful in an array when we are working in an array with various data types. For example, it
would be difficult to increase the increment of each integer in an array when there are booleans and strings
in the set.


### 6. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
+ Loops are ways to repeat the same process over and over again without having to do the work.
+ For example, imagine we're on a cookie diet. The only catch is that we have to make fresh cookies everyday for each meal. Baking cookies is really fun! Until you have to do it three times a day in the summer. So, what if we built a machine that put the cookies together, we just had to tell it what type we want! That's essentially what a loop is! We have our ingredients in a list called an "array" and we put it in a loop that mixes the ingredients. We can add and take away ingredients to the array whether we want chocolate chip, sugar, or double chocolate cookies. The cookie machine will put together the dough and bake it for us just how we want.

### 7. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
+ Besides "for loops", what are the other commonly used types?
+ How are loops used with booleans and strings?
