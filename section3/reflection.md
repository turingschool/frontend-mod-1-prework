## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

The first point that resonated with me was that you can have both "fixed mindset" and "growth mindset" in different parts of your life. Upon reflection, I see that this is true for me personally as I develop some skills, like rock climbing, I understand the process and don't get as easily discouraged. However with cake decorating, if I don't have a beautiful cake the first time I try a new technique then I am upset and believe it wasn't even worth trying. Another point that resonated with me was not comparing my progress to others but instead compare it to my own progress. I have heard this before but I think I need to really focus on this during my time at Turing. Everyone in my cohort is coming in at different levels and I already know that some have way more knowledge than I do so I need to remind myself that is okay, I will get there too.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

I currently demonstrate Growth Mindset by developing action plans to achieve goals. I will break down the steps of what I want and work on them one at a time. I don't demonstrate "Growth Mindset" when something goes wrong and my first reaction is to panic. The panic is usually going into "worst case scenario" mode and believing nothing will work out. I then have to bring myself back from the edge and make another action plan.     

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

Google search engine probably uses Arrays to store the search results of what I or a user search for. Each link listed/displayed would be one element of the Array.

2. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

Array methods change what we do to the elements in the array without having to type the entire array out again.

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

The purpose of a loop is to have the computer perform an action **n** times for as long as the condition returns true but you only have to write one code instead of writing it repeatedly. You would use a loop with an array if you want the loop to cycle through/iterate each element of your array. You would use a loop without an array if you just want the same action repeated **n** times.

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

Loops are when you do the same thing again and again however many times your Mom tells you too. You don't do anything else until you have finished either.

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?

I am still hazy on loops-arrays. I break the code down into a flowchart but have trouble translating that into what code to write. For example I really struggled with the "YOU DO Voting" work. I don't understand clearly how to write multiple conditions for a loop to go through before producing it's answer?
