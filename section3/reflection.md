## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
- The first point in the article resonated with me: that having a growth mindset is associated with "mastery" and "learning oriented behaviors."  Since learning about growth mindset, I've been more actively exercising and practicing beneficial thinking strategies.

- The second point that resonated with me is to try to go past your "Zone of Proximal Development."  This taught me to stretch a little bit further.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
- I have been listening to an audiobook on Growth Mindset by Carol Dweck.  One way that I've been applying what I've learned to the book is to not rest on my laurels but continue to improve and work on the projects.  Actively thinking, "OK, let's get this project/task finished" is a great way to think.

Sometimes, I don't like to fail so I may not always want to act for fear of making a mistake.

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.
- A stock investing app may have Arrays to list out the stocks/companies that they offer.

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
An Array method is a function that you can run on an Array that will check, inspect, or modify elements in that array.  Examples include using the `push` method to add items to the end of the array, or the `length` method to return the number of elements in the array.

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
A loop is used to run lines of code, either for a specific number of times, or while a condition is `true`.  

Loops are used in conjunction with arrays when it's necessary to run code for each item in the array.  When there isn't an array, or it's not needed to run the code on every item in the array, a loop in conjunction with an array isn't needed.

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
- A loop lets me do something over and over.  

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
- I would like to know how to work with logical operators and `if` and `if else` statements
- I would like to know a little more about the syntax of loops.
- I would like to know more about `for...while` loops.
