## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?  



1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?  

I think seeking out challenges and not being afraid to seek help are two growth mindsets that I need to start using more often. I rarely ever seek help or want to. Seeking out challenges is always fun, but for learning and growing I think I definitely need to start doing it more often. Two that I already demonstrate is setting SMART goals and understanding that experience and practice is essential for growth. I am a hands on learner and experience and practice is vital to me learning and growing. Also, if I set goals for myself it helps me look forward to learning.

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.  

One application / website that I use regularly is Steam. Steam has an array of video game types for sale. Ex: Survival, Adventure, Action, RPG, Racing  

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.  

An Array method is a method that changes an array. This could remove an element from an array, add an element to an array, count the length of an array, etc.

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?  

The purpose of a loop is to iterate a part of your program multiple times. You would use a loop when you want to change multiple elements and log it. If you only need the array to repeat once then there is no need for a loop.  

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?  

A loop is how we make the program repeat something multiple times. This is easier than typing it out each time, instead the program does it for us.   

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?  

Can we make a loop for multiple arrays?
