## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

One point from the Growth Mindset article that resonated with me was practicing setting S.M.A.R.T. goals: Setting specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Timebound goals to help approach learning code. This is a vary handy acronym that breaks down the process of learning new material into achievable actions. I have always been a fan of distilling and separating the goal or project into logical steps. I think the S.M.A.R.T. acronym is great and very useful. The second point that resonated with me was from the video when they talked about the importance of observing how one is struggling. I think it is very useful to not just understand you are struggling but to be able to discern how you are struggling. There are many different ways people struggle to understand new material, some of it can be as simple as not feeling super focused that day and some of it can be more of a process and needing to break down the material and understand it by chunks. Taking a moment to understand why and how you are struggling will help lead you to solving the problem of why your struggling and will lead you to understand the problem you are struggling with.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

I am always seeking out new challenges! Prior to starting Turing I worked as an installation artist and I used that platform to always be learning new methods and working with new materials and concepts. Before that I worked as a illustrator and was finding new ways to perfect my drawing and before that I was learning about gardening and urban homesteading (this list kinda goes on forever). I see coding as another tool in my toolbox of skills.

On the flip side of always seeking out new challenges, I think it always holds me back on having a Growth Mindset. I can really get obsessed with the beginnings of learning a new skill, but within a year or two drop it and move to another things. I do think there is something to be said about the importance of learning deeper into the mastery of the skill.

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

A web/mobile application that uses arrays is Petfinders. When someone is looking for a pet they put details of what they are looking for: type of pet, size, age, breed type, etc. That is one of the arrays and then each of the pets on petfinders have an array that has a specific array that describes them.

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
Array method is a to understand or manipulate the array. The `.length` method outputs the amount of indexes of an array, but the push/pull etc methods will either input a index in the array or remove.

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

The purpose of a loop is to be able to run a block of code repetitively until it is told to stop (once the condition becomes false). We would use it in conjunction with an array when there is an array that the indexes of the array needs to be run separately through the code. We would not use an array with a loop when there are not different indexes that need to be run through a block of code.

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

Loops are like cleaning up your toys off the floor. The loop will continue as long as toy on the floor is still true, once you put a toy in the box you look and see if there is another toy, if yes, put another toy in the box. Repeat until there are toys on the floor is false.

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
I am excited to see this how arrays and loops are used in more complicated scenarios. In the example I had with PetFinders, the user puts in the data into an array and there is an array for each pet. My questions is how do those two arrays interact with each other to match a pet to the user.
