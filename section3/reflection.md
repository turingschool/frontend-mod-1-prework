## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

I liked the points about self comparison, and seeking out challenges. I like to focus on not comparing myself to anyone but myself. All that matters is that I make progress forward and it doesn't matter how I get there or how fast. It's most important to keep moving forward. Seeking out challenges is important to me. I believe to have a growth mindset, you should want new experiences that test your previous knowledge and maybe some knowledge you don't quite grasp yet. I think it's really important to always want that extra challenge, otherwise, how do you grow?

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

I think I currently demonstrate a growth mindset in how I tackle problems or struggles. I will take the time to understand why a mistake was made, and take the time to figure out a problem in depth. I think my best learning is done when I am actively figuring out a problem that maybe didn't go as smoothly as I anticipated. I think it is hard to not compare oneself to others and sometimes I fall into that trap. During these times, I fail to stay in a growth mindset, because my mindset is on others and not on my own progress.

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

In my bank application, developers probably use arrays to store my balances, credits, debits..etc in arrays, the days for each month stored are on an array..I can see how it would be very applicable in many scenarios.

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

An array is an object that has functions known as methods. These methods are built in functions for the array object which perform certain tasks or objectives. For example .length will give us the integer amount of data stored in an array.

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

A loop is used to execute a block of code more than one time until a condition is met. We would use a loop in conjunction with an array if we wanted to check a condition for each piece of data in the array. Alternatively a loop could be used to loop without an array if we only needed to check a condition for one variable.

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

Loops are like twisty slides. As we slide down the slide, our bodies go around in a circle. Each time we go around the circle, our bodies check to see if we are at the bottom yet, if we are not, we keep sliding, if we are at the bottom, our bodies stop!

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?

Regarding the question above, I am not actually too sure when it would be useful to use a loop without an array?
