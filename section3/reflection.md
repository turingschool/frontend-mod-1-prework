## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

I resonated with "Mistakes are essential to learning". I really like the process of troubleshooting. "Zone of Proximal Development" is new to me, a zone where problem solving takes place within reach of current capability with some guidance.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

I think I'm great at focusing on the process and realizing mistakes will be made along the way. I'm not so good at setting specific goals, but I usually give myself deadlines to complete work by and set aside the time.

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

Likes on Instagram. When you open it, you can see a list of users who liked the post. The users are the individual values within an array.

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

An array method is a function that we can apply to our array that can perform changes to text, order, and
perform calculations with numbers.

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

A loop performs the tasks within it a user-specified number of times.
With array, when we are trying to log certain parts of the array to the console by iteration.
Without array, when we are looking to count up and down numbers declared by var i.

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

We're gonna make this robot dig up the yard until we find **treasure!** We're going to program it to dig and dump, over and over, until we get rich!

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?

What are more applications for these, and what are examples of loops with and without arrays on a website?
