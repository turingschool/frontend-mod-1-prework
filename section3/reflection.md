## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

- [ ] In which ways do I demonstrate a growth mindset? **_I currently do a fair bit of SQL coding. One way I demonstrate a growth mindset is the recognition that my programming skills and programs that I've written can be improved. Even small items like adjusting time zone conversion code or incrementally improving CASE statements or adding additional fields can improve the code and the output for the business case/question at hand. I also conduct a ton of quality control on my code because I recognize that I might not fully understand the database structure and/or the data elements contained with the data set. The lack of fully visibility can lead to code that seems to work but might contain errors based on not properly joining the database or data integrity issues._**
- [ ] In which ways do I not demonstrate a growth mindset? **_I can improve my use of open source resources. I've actively use google to search for resolution to issues beyond my skill set or to reframe a challenge, but I've been hesitant to learn how GitHub might help because I find the user interface crude and difficult to understand. My time and the structure provided by Turing has and will help immensely by exposing me to both others working on the same challenges while teaching me how to learn and use these tools._**

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

- [ ] Provide an example of an array, and explain why it might be used? **_I love to use the example of a shopping basket. Since a shopping basked on amazon.com, as an example, is in the most basic form a list of items it seems reasonable that developers might use an array. In addition, there are many common functions or tasks that need to be performed like determining availability, determining price plus taxes and determining shipping that can be repeatively applied to each item in the shopping basket array as part of the ongoing construction of the basket or during the checkout._**

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

- [ ] What is an array method? **_An array method that performs a task on an array. Two examples provided in the video were arrayName.sort in which ".sort" is a method that will arrange items in the array in alpha and/or numeric order. Another example was arrayName.reverse which would reverse the order of items in an array._**

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

- [ ] What is the purpose of a loop? **_The purpose of a loop is perform a task multiple times or repeatively. A loop allows code to be created once to perform the task repeatively rather than duplicating the code._**
- [ ] When might a loop be used in conjunction with an array and without? **_A loop is used in conjunction with an array when it is necessary to perform a task to each item/element in that array._**

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

- [ ] How would you explain loops to a 5 year old? **_A loop is like throwing a ball for the dog. We throw the ball. The dog returns the ball. Then we throw it again. We continue to do it until the dog gets tired or the we reach the end of the walk or we don't have any more time to walk to the dog._**

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?

- [ ] Additional questions? **_None at this time._**
