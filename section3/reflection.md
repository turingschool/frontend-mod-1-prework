## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
- **I've thought a lot about Growth Mindset and the various things I'll do to set myself up for success during (and after!) my time at Turing. I very much appreciate this early emphasis and I'm already looking forward to getting out of my comfort zone again.**
- **Letting mistakes be learning experiences is something that resonated with me. I recognize up to this point in life I've avoided a lot of opportunities out of fear of failure when I should be finding more ways to embrace it.**

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
- **I think I have a solid grasp on Growth Mindset conceptually, but the difficulty lies in the implementation. I know what I should do but am not always the best at following through (and with that being said, I'm usually my own worst critic and should continue easing up on myself!). But I'm starting to make some real habit changes, like meditating at the start of every morning.**

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.
- **My budgeting app, Mint, most likely uses arrays for different transactions, different bank accounts, different categories for sorting budget. There are probably many more arrays I can't even ponder at the moment in the backend database.**

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
- **Array methods are functions that do something to the array itself, such as removing the last value of the array or replacing the first value with a new one.**

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
- **A loop allows programmers to repeat lines of code with specific parameters in order to prevent from typing the same lines of code over and over again.**

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
- **Think about what 2 + 2 is. Now imagine if you could keep adding 2 to that number as many times as you want without having to say "2 + 2 equals" or "4 + 2 equals" over and over again. Pretty cool, huh?**

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
- **None at this time, more down the road!**
