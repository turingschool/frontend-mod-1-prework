## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

I realized that I didn’t know about Setting Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-Bound goals helps you to approach learning to code with clarity, focus, and use of appropriate strategies.

Also I’m learning that struggling with something or not understanding it is good, that means that I’m growing.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

Just the fact that I am trying to learn programming and that I’m giving myself multiple shots at it is demonstrating that I have a growth mindset. In the past, I would have just said I suck at this, it’s not meant for me and I would’ve given up.

I think sometimes I don’t demonstrate a growth mindset when I compare myself to other people who are way ahead of me in life. I forget to look at how far I’ve come. Also, I realize sometimes, I feel bad about myself when I have to think a lot about a problem, I expect myself to automatically come up with a solution, so I’ll try to change that as best as I can.


1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

On CraigsList, developers probably use arrays to list all the vehicles for sale within a certain vicinity.
You could have a list of all the different cars, or a list of all motorcycles within the vicinity of a certain
zipcode.

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

An array method, is a method that either returns a value or somehow allows you to manipulate an array.
I think that they're pretty helpful that they're built in to JavaScript, because otherwise you would have
to program all those behaviors yourself.

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

The purpose of a loop is to be able to do a command or run a line of code many times, so usually
it saves you time because you don't have to type out a command hundreds or even thousands of times.

We could use a loop and array together to print all of the items out of an array. Especially if it's a big array.
If you don't need to access or print out all the indices of the array then you can just avoid using a for loop.

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

I'd say Johnny, let's make some step to brush your teeth. And ask Johnny to be specific about the steps. If he said
we need to do it a certain amount of times, I'd ask what action? and then have him right down the amount of time we do
said action.
`Action (x times)`
` thing  you do`

That's kind of the brief model that I'd use, but I think another example could be to use an example like how to take off the tire of a car. Johnny, how many lugnuts are there? He could say 5. And then I would ask, "What specific steps do we have to do to
remove one lugnut?" I would make him break it down, and then ask, "How many times do we have to do those actions Johnny?"

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
What other tricks are there to access the elements inside an object? I'd like to know more resources to see
how we can use loops inside of objects.
