## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

I really like the S.M.A.R.T. approach to breaking large chunks of work into smaller ones, allowing us/me to be realistic and more effective when tackling overwhelming work. This idea is definitely something that I am going to further look into.

"It is more likely that you will face coding challenges that ask you to learn and push a little beyond what youâ€™ve already mastered."

Personally, this idea matches up with the workflow in module zero, and I believe that "pushing" is intentional. Pushing students to figure something out on their own, at a realistic pace, gets you out of your comfort zone and I learn faster.


From the video, the idea of the fixed vs. growth mindset was something that I found really interesting. This idea is brand new to me, yet made sense immediately.


1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

I enjoy challenge seeking. I have found that I have a tendency to get bored with something if it does not allow me opportunity to leave my comfort zone and figure something out myself.
I am not afraid to look stupid and ask questions that may make me feel "less" than the others around me.

Looking back to the idea of the S.M.A.R.T. approach, I do not break work down into small enough pieces. I am a work in progress.

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

Pretty much all of the social media platforms likely do use arrays. An example could be the devs at Facebook approaching a user's friend list in array form, or an array for a list of their post times.

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
An array method is used as a data structure containing multiple values as a single variable.


1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
A loop is used to repeat tasks based on a condition. We would use a loop in conjunction with an array to evaluate how a condition evaluation would turn out based on data in the array. Without an array, a loop using recursive functions that call themselves would qualify.

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
A loop would be like if I asked you to bring me a silver marble, you came back with one of another color, and I have you keep searching & bringing marbles back to me until you bring me a silver one, then, we're finished!

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
Wow. Are there methods of truncating the JS code for arrays & loops to make it look cleaner? If that makes sense...
