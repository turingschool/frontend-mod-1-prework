## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
   - Fixed Mindset versus Growth Mindset. Listening to this reassured an aspect of my personality that I have always liked. A younger me, the me though high school and even college felt rigid and even fearful - but something snapped and I learned that is NOT me. And that I can always change and grow and learn, and that struggling is NOT a bad thing. It's beautiful. It's the entire point.
   - The idea of the Zone of Proximal Development (not very catchy...) was an idea that resonates with me, but I never had a word/phrase for (and still don't lol). I like that idea that growth happens within a reasonable range of my skills. I feel I can apply this to skiing, I grew my constantly pushing myself a little little bit, and then reaching into something scarier and more challenging - in order to shift where the center of my ZPD was. That way, I was continually moving forward.

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
   - I currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset by constantly applying myself to new challenges. At this phase of my life most of these challenges are physical. What is the heaviest thing I can pick up, can I learn how to ride a horse, can I learn to ski in my late 20s. And no part of me thought No, I cannot. I also have recently begun (outside of coding) thinking of mistakes as the place where learning happens. That discomfort is actually a learning sensation. Something I do NOT do - is set achievable goals for myself. I tend to set far away, ambiguous goals that I cannot meet because they are too nebulous! I think in a way this is to keep a fantasy alive (aka being an olympic show jumper), but also to protect my feelings. I can't feel disappointed in myself if i never _really_ believed I would meet my goal.

3. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.
   - My gym has a webpage where we can choose our classes and sign up. When our instructors need to check to see who is attending each class - I imagine the website stores that information in an array so it can easily be added to, removed, from, displayed in entirety, and show the number of items in the array.

4. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
   - Methods are tools to manipulate arrays. To add or subtract, sort, or manipulate the information within the array.

5. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
   - Loops allow us to do a process repeatedly without having to repeat code. The action is repeated a specified number of times. We would use a loop with an array to apply the same process or evaluation to each element. You would choose to use a loop without an array to repeat a prompt a number of times, or count upwards or downwards in numbers.

6. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
   -Loops are a way to tell a computer to do the EXACT same thing over and over again until I tell it to stop.

7. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
   - What is a practical reason to use a loop without an array? The examples we used don't seem practical.
