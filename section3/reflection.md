## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
I really like the idea of seeking out challenges to grow, and build resilience.
The SMART goals method was new to me, and that seems like a really good way to get yourself to do things.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
I certainly do believe that I can grow, improve in my abilities, and be better about how I do things than I currently am.
I am not approaching things in a systematic fashion, like was suggested in the SMART goals.

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.
In Spotify I believe that the developers use arrays to organize the songs contained within an album, or a playlist. An album could be a variable containing multiple values (songs) in it.

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
An array method is a method, or function that act upon an array or the elements that it contains

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
A loop allows you to have a block of code continue to be run until certain condiotions are met. Using a loop with an array can be useful if you want to run a block of code with all or certain elements of the array, without having to manually do so.

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
You know the game Red Light, Green Light? When it's green light, you keep trying to get closer to the person who's it, and when it's red light you stop. The loop keeps doing something until something tells it red light.

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
