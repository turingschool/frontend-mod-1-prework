## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

While this (growth mindset) is a topic that was extensively covered in my master's in social work program as it relates to supporting clients' growth, this was the first time I read about this topic as it directly related to my own journey towards learning to code. One of the main points that struck me and I will have to continuously remind myself of is that I cannot dwell on the speed at which I am learning vs others' process. I have had this said to me by a few software developer friends at this point, and while prior to Mod 0 I heard it, I didn't understand how easy it would be to devolve into that harmful habit of comparing myself to others. I need to keep in mind that part of a growth mindset will include allowing myself to learn and struggle and grow from that cycle.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

One way that I currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset is that I allow myself to ask questions, even if it feels like I'm exposing myself to being less skilled than others. It is important to me that I place value in my learning process and ask questions when necessary, even if it stings my ego momentarily in the process.
One way I do not demonstrate Growth Mindset is that I judge myself for struggling. While I continue to push myself to understand a process/new topic, I find that I engage in negative self-talk about my capacity in the process. I know this needs to be different, because as the author Villanueva stated, I do not want to continue to "punish" myself while attempting to understand.

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.
Yelp: Arrays likely exist within Yelp to help display whatever type of restaurant being searched, by order of the criteria being searched.

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

An Array method is a simple way for a program to change something about an existing array that will suit the needs of that script.

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
The purpose of a loop is to facilitate the repetition of a particular code, rather than spending time console.logging it out each time. A loop would be used in conjunction with an array when there's a need for a program to run a script several times using different elements from the array. 

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

Loops are a way that will help you say something a bunch of times without having to say it a bunch of times. When you want your computer to do something 10 times, instead of saying it or writing it ten times, by using a loop,  it will know that you need this thing said or done ten times and then do it by itself.


1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?

I know that I still need to practice "connecting the dots" so to speak in regards to making connections between the different sections/lessons. I will need to thoroughly reflect and review what I've learned so far, and look up more examples of how to apply them together.
