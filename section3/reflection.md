## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

* I really enjoyed the video with Cameron Popoviciu. Two concepts that resonated for me with the video came from the same couple lines: - "I'm struggling with something, I should not panic" and - "I don't know something, how can I fix it."
That kind of mentality is so brilliant and pragmatic. Panicking doesn't help the problem solving process; look at what can be fixed instead.
* The definitions of Fixed vs. Growth mindset were also really interesting. I had not really heard of the two compared like that before.
* Another good take away was "Accept and act upon instead of give up."

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

* Frankly, if I'd been asked this 10 years ago, I would have a long list in the "not" section. I didn't realize that I had been adopting more of a growth mindset in the last few years. I have had a greater focus on learning from mistakes instead of being terrified to make them. I've also been more open to challenging myself, such as going back to school, where I would not have before.

* I definitely have some way that I'm not demonstrating - still hesitant to ask for help and still worried about failure. Mistakes I've gotten better about, but a feeling of failing is still challenging.

3. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

* I use Thriftbooks a lot to continue to boost my book collection. I'd imagine that an array of times I'm active on the site may be helpful. If they have that information and notice a lull in my activity, that might cause them to send an email to try to encourage me to check out a deal or two.

4. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

* An array method is a way to manipulate or utilize the information that is stored within the array. There are methods to make changes to the array's elements and methods to call certain elements.

5. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

* Loops are to perform iterations for various specific tasks. Loops can be used in conjunction with arrays when there is need to access or use multiple or all elements within that array.
Loops can also be used for performing repetitive tasks that do not require the collection of data an array provides.

6. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

* A loop is asking the computer to repeat the same thing over and over until it reaches the end of what you want it to do. It's like picking up beads that spilled on the table. You have to pick up each bead and put it away over and over until all the beads are back in the container. Then your work is complete.

7. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?

* With the continue keyword - it seems like loops are designed to continue until they don't. I'm curious what the purpose or situations that would warrent the use of that keyword?
