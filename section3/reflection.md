## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
~ *Two that resonated with me (from the article) were the points about seeking out challenges and understanding that being willing
   to make mistakes is crucial to real learning.*

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
~ *I've not used the S.M.A.R.T. goals system before, not by name, at least. Perhaps some of the principles within it, but certainly
   not intentionally nor with that level of clarity. My life is founded on the principles of a Growth Mindset since early childhood
   (although I had not hear the term nor had even known this was a "thing" until about two years ago; before that, I'd just
   unconsciously assumed that everyone had a Growth Mindset).*

3. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use arrays? Explain.
~ *Multiple arrays are probably used to store comments from the comments section according to the possible sorting filters (i.e. sort by  
   new, sort by most popular, etc).*

4. In your own words, explain what an Array Method is.
~ *An Array Method is simply a function that is pre-built into the coding language itself, and which is specifically designed exclusively
   for utilization by/for interaction with arrays.*

5. What is the purpose of a loop? When would we use a loop in conjunction with an array vs. not?
~ *The purpose of a loop is to iterate over a code block a set number of times in order to forego the need to write out the iterations
   "by hand" (or rather, one by one), and to reduce the amount of reading the program has to do in order to execute the code. Less time
   writing/reading, more time doing.
  Loops are used in conjunction with arrays when there is a need to perform the same action/set of actions upon each element in a given
   array. Loops used with arrays are known colloquially as "domestic loops". "Wild loops" are loops that are not being used to iterate through an array. You can usually find wild loops by looking for any block of code that is iterating multiple times, but isn't looking
   through a set list, per se. I definitely know what I'm talking about.*

6. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain them?
~ *A loop is a lot like a circle. It goes round and round and it comes back home to where it started! Then, it goes around again and comes
   back home! Every time it gets home, it tidies up, does some chores, makes itself some breakfast, or some lunch, and sometimes even dinner,
   depending on the time of day when it gets back home. That's why it has to check the clock when it gets back, to see if it's time to eat
   breakfast, lunch, or dinner! After it makes dinner, it knows that it only has to go around once more, then it's time to go to bed...
   tomorrow, it can start with a brand new day!*


7. What questions do you still have about arrays and loops?
~ *I'd like to know more about how to manipulate data types and such within arrays and loops. I find especially that, when referencing
   data by its index number, the methods used to manipulate these are extremely specific/context specific, and aren't always very intuitive.*
