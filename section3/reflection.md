## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

1. A growth mindset will be essential to become a good and competent software developer. If we are afraid of failure, then we will be afraid to try things, or ask questions to learn.

2. How important community will be to both Turing, but even afterwards in the professional world, learning from and with others is vital.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

**Do**
*I love learning and continuing to make mistakes and figuring out how to fix them is important to learning.
*I have to remember that even when I get discouraged, I am still driving the bus forward and to give up would be a fixed mindset, whereas to keep moving forward, is accepting failure as a teaching mechanism and learn from it.
*The challenges that come with coding are both exhilarating and sometimes frustrating (which leads into _not_).

**Don't**
*I am sometimes afraid to ask my questions because they seem so simple and if I just thought through it more or had a better search strategy, I would have gotten it on my own. But I am always so grateful to see other's questions, so I need to get out of my way because this a great way to learn from and connect with others.


1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

***I use the hiking website AllTrails pretty often to plan hikes, and within that app, I think for each hike's data that there would be arrays used to list information together that is specific to a certain detail. For example if I am looking at a hike about Whiteface Mountain, a possible array might be var treesOnWhiteface = ['birch trees', 'pine trees', 'balsam trees', 'oak trees']***

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

_An Array method allows us to manipulate the strings of listed elements in the array. Some examples would include: removing an element from the list, adding elements to the list, counting out the length of the list, printing out only specific parts of the list, and changing the name of an element within the array._


1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

_A loop's purpose lets us utilize an array and manipulate the data operations so that we aren't writing out the code individually by each calculation and running the code until specific conditionals that we as the coders set. It saves us a lot of time, and lets us see the data output quickly (especially when related to something with a high amount of numbers or a huge amount of lists. An example of us of a loop in conjunction with an array is the grocery list exercise we did where we added individual foods to the list and instead of adding them to the list by re-typing the code each time, we could just have them listed for us using the array's list. Without an array, we use a loop to calculate individual data, for example solving math problems, we can see quickly the output of numbers calculated beyond what we can easily do and get the entire output delivered to us._


1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

_If I were teaching a 5 year old about loops, I would first try to break it down to the simplest definition possible:_

*Loop: this is something we can use to repeat an action as many times as we tell it to.
*In order for us to use a loop, we have to write it out the way we want it to work.
*We write it out using a special type of code so that we can tell the computer that we want it to keep adding or taking away items until it finishes.
*So for example if we are trying to add up to 100, it would take us a long time to do that typing it out each time.
But we can write a line of code to count it out for us:

*First we are going to name the thing we are counting, so lets say we are counting to 100 toys:

var toys

from there we need to set up a line of code to let us make this loop work, so we know we are counting toys
but we need set the number of toys to zero, then that we want to set it so that the computer knows it should count out to 100 by saying less than 100 or until it is equal, and that we want the loop to count every line of code by one. We can change the way it counts but let's try this first.  

for (var toys =0; toys <= 100; toys++) {
console.log(toys);
}

So if we run this in a console, it will count out to 100 as quickly as we can blink our eyes. If we had to type out 1 to 100, one at a time, we would take much longer.



1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?

1. What is the best way to memorize the many different array methods?

2. How can a loop best be combined with conditional statements? This is something I am struggling with regarding the challenge exercise in this part.
